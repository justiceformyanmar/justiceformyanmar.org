The transfers come as the military intensifies attacks against civilians as part of a widening campaign of terror. The transfers were found in Indian export data, analysed by Justice For Myanmar as part of an <a href="../stories/bharat-electronics-limited-supplying-military-technology-to-myanmar-since-attempted-coup.html">investigation into BEL</a> published today. Justice For Myanmar calls on BEL to immediately end their commercial relationship with the Myanmar military and close their Myanmar office. </p><p>The transfers include technology for a coastal surveillance system supported by the Indian government. The system could involve technology connected to Terma in Denmark, which has an agreement with BEL for coastal surveillance radars, or Thales, which according to information seen by Justice For Myanmar, has sold radars to Myanmar. <strong>Update </strong>(Jun. 14, 2021)<strong>:</strong> Terma denies the possibility that BEL could export Terma radars or technology to Myanmar.</p><p><strong>Justice For Myanmar spokesperson Yadanar Maung says:</strong> <em>“We are appalled that BEL is continuing to supply technology to the Myanmar military, even after its brutal and illegal attempted coup. To date, the military has killed more than 860 people including children as young as 4 years old, has arrested more than 4,700 and displaced 200,000 ethnic civilians. It is deplorable that BEL is prioritising Myanmar as a foreign market and operates an office in Yangon to support their business with the criminal military cartel. The Indian government is awarding legitimacy to the junta through BEL’s business in Myanmar, enabling the junta’s nationwide campaign of terror against the people of Myanmar. BEL partner companies, their governments and shareholders must now step up and take a clear moral stance to end BEL’s business with the military. BEL’s despicable conduct, putting profits above Myanmar people’s lives, shows why there must be a global arms embargo now!”</em></p><p>BEL has partnerships in place with SAAB (Sweden), Thales (France/Netherlands), Terma (Denmark), Israel Aerospace Industries (Israel), Elbit Systems (Israel), Beretta and Elettronica (Italy). </p><p>BEL’s biggest international shareholders include Goldman Sachs (USA), Nippon Life Insurance (Japan), Mirae Asset Financial Group (South Korea), Dimensional Fund Advisors (USA), Franklin Templeton (USA), Norges Bank Investment Management (Norway), Ninety One (UK), the Vanguard Group (USA) and BNP Paribas (France).</p><h4>Note to editors</h4><p>See Justice For Myanmar investigation into BEL’s transfers of military technology to Myanmar: <a href="../stories/bharat-electronics-limited-supplying-military-technology-to-myanmar-since-attempted-coup.html">www.justiceformyanmar.org/stories/bharat-electronics-limited-supplying-military-technology-to-myanmar-since-attempted-coup </a></p><p><a href="../index.html">Justice For Myanmar</a>, a group of covert activists campaigning for justice and accountability for the people of Myanmar, is calling for an end to military business and for federal democracy and a sustainable peace.</p><p>ENDS</p><p>For more information please contact: </p><p>Yadanar Maung </p><p>Email: <a href="mailto:media@justiceformyanmar.org ">media@justiceformyanmar.org </a></p><p>Website: <a href="../index.html">https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/</a> </p><p>Mirror: <a href="https://justiceformyanmar.github.io/justiceformyanmar.org/">https://justiceformyanmar.github.io/justiceformyanmar.org/ </a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/justicemyanmar">@justicemyanmar</a> </p><p>Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/justiceformyanmar.org/">https://www.facebook.com/justiceformyanmar.org/</a></p><p>‍</p></div></main></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876/js/webflow.b418536c3.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]--></body></html>

Internet shutdowns have fortified the military’s oppressive <a href="https://www.thechindwin.com/myanmars-military-junta-reintroduces-the-four-cuts-strategy-against-civilians/" target="_blank"><strong>“Four Cuts” strategy</strong></a> — a military campaign to indiscriminately destroy anything or anyone deemed to support the raging popular resistance movement on the ground.  <strong>As places continue to be wiped out amidst communications blackouts, the international community and companies tasked to enforce the junta’s orders have remained largely silent. This must change. </strong></p><p><strong>Internet shutdowns have been imposed across regions where resistance against the military has been most intense, and where arson attacks by the junta  have been most widespread as both punishment, and cover for atrocities.</strong> In one of the worst-hit regions of Sagaing, internet, mobile and landline connections have been shut down since late 2021, with access only available intermittently for a few hours every few days. Out of 34 townships in Sagaing, eight are facing regular internet blackouts, while  the other townships have access only to 2G connections.  <a href="https://www.ispmyanmar.com/more-than-22000-homes-and-buildings-torched-after-the-coup/" target="_blank"><strong>Reports</strong></a> indicate that more than 22,000 sites including residential and religious buildings have been burned down between February 1 to May 2022.

This is all being perpetrated with impunity amidst recurring internet shutdowns, now in place in <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1wwUFrhqUUtmGLzgwxSBycHxqM8SzazMF?fbclid=IwAR1RXvSC1TA7mc115L4mmDQnT_-VIgXduwJFpiK4W2H8mqu8Wuxx_4W7wLQ" target="_blank"><strong>at least 54 townships </strong></a>across the country.</p><p><strong>As shutdowns continue indefinitely, people are not only impacted by active conflict, but struggle to lead daily lives. </strong>Those attempting to leave their homes have no means to find out information to help keep themselves safe, such as where attacks may be launched or where road bombs may be laid. People who wish to find out how their friends, family, or loved ones are coping cannot communicate with them. Transport of essential supplies is blocked to villages, as drivers are unable to discern safe routes for travel. People are unable to <a href="https://www.myanmar-responsiblebusiness.org/news/return-full-mobile-internet.html" target="_blank"><strong>transfer or receive funds</strong></a> as they are cut off from <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-junta-hits-opposition-forces-with-communications-blackouts-/6550158.html" target="_blank"><strong>mobile payment services</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Amidst a pandemic, people have no way to share health information or receive medical attention, in <a href="https://www.icj.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Myanmar-COVID19-Briefing-Paper-2020-ENG.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>violation</strong></a> of their right to health, and risks of gender-based violence are <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/covid-19-and-coup-blockage-internet-and-social-media-access-further-exacerbate-gender" target="_blank"><strong>exacerbated</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Meanwhile, children who were already unable to receive in-school education because of ongoing school boycotts and burnt down schools are now cut out of online means of learning, leading to an increasing number of school dropout cases and reported cases of child abuse through forced <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1wwUFrhqUUtmGLzgwxSBycHxqM8SzazMF?fbclid=IwAR1RXvSC1TA7mc115L4mmDQnT_-VIgXduwJFpiK4W2H8mqu8Wuxx_4W7wLQ" target="_blank"><strong> child marriages</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Humanitarian actors and many journalists who remain in the country <a href="https://restofworld.org/2022/blackouts-myanmar-atrocities/" target="_blank"><strong>struggle</strong></a> to monitor and report on the ongoing human rights violations and provide <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements/2022/06/50th-session-human-rights-council-oral-update-myanmar" target="_blank"><strong>essential aid</strong></a>, while UN experts have <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/06/myanmar-un-experts-condemn-militarys-digital-dictatorship" target="_blank"><strong>highlighted</strong></a> challenges to their gathering of evidence of human rights violations. </p><p><strong>This situation on the ground will only deteriorate unless international actors continue to keep global attention on Myanmar and push back strongly against aggression by the junta.</strong> <strong> </strong>The military must not be allowed to perpetrate crimes with impunity under the cloak of darkness, and governments and companies must push back.</p><p> <strong>Governments must:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Continue to prioritize the situation in Myanmar as a matter of policy and publicly condemn crimes and rights violations committed by the military;</li><li>Take active and effective measures to push for accountability for violations, including through engaging international fora, including at the United Nations, and supporting civil society efforts for accountability through international, regional or domestic mechanisms;</li><li>Provide financial and technical support to human rights defenders, journalists and civil society members — including digital rights activists and people living outside of Myanmar particular, network providers and mobile companies to continue essential work documenting, reporting on and advocating against ongoing human rights abuses;

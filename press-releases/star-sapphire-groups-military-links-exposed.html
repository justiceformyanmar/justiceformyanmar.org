No public information was found regarding its activities. </p><p>In the energy sector, Star Sapphire Group’s Myanmar Business Consultant Group is the local partner of the Hong Kong-listed company <a href="http://vpower.com/">VPower Group</a> and the Chinese state-owned firm <a href="http://www.cntic.com.cn">China National Technical Import and Export Corporation</a> (CNTIC) in a liquified natural gas project involving MEHL. </p><p>Myanmar Business Consultant Group channels funds to MEHL for the land and will transfer the facility to MEHL at the end of the lease, providing the military with a lucrative future asset. </p><p>In Tanintharyi Region, Star Sapphire is developing a 200 MW combined cycle power plant with <a href="https://www.unitedpowerofasia.com/">United Power of Asia</a>, a Thai publicly listed company associated with Tun Min Latt and Upakit Pachariyangkun. </p><p><strong>Justice For Myanmar spokesperson Yadanar Maung says:</strong> “Tun Min Latt and his associates have spent decades enriching themselves through the Myanmar military’s systemic corruption. </p><p>“They have provided the military with both revenue and arms that have fuelled atrocity crimes against the people of Myanmar, and are therefore complicit in those crimes. </p><p>“The military junta is a terrorist organisation that continues to commit international crimes with total impunity, including deliberate killings, indiscriminate airstrikes and shelling, torture, arbitrary detention and rape.</p><p>“Urgent targeted sanctions must now be imposed against Dr Tun Min Latt, Star Sapphire Group of Companies and their directors and shareholders.</p><p>“Tun Min Latt has used Thailand as a base for illicit business activities, including operating an illegal casino with Upakit Pachariyangkun and the Myanmar army, and banking with Siam Commercial Bank. This must stop.  </p><p>“As a senator, Upakit Pachariyangkun&#x27;s business dealings with Tun Min Latt and the Myanmar military require public scrutiny. </p><p>“We urge Thai civil society to take action and ensure Upakit is held accountable for his corrupt business dealings and complicity in the Myanmar military’s international crimes.</p><p>“Tun Min Latt&#x27;s use of Thailand and Singapore for his business with the Myanmar military is yet another case of ASEAN&#x27;s failed five-point consensus, one year on, continuing to <a href="../stories/asean-governments-and-companies-complicit-in-the-myanmar-militarys-atrocity-crimes.html">enable military-linked business</a>.</p><p>“ASEAN’s failed “consensus” has only served to block and delay effective action from the UN and international community, while conflicts of interest within ASEAN governments embolden the junta to continue its terror campaign against the people.</p><p>“The international community must stop hiding behind ASEAN and impose targeted sanctions and a global arms embargo to block the flow of arms and funds to the terrorist junta, and to support the Myanmar people&#x27;s Spring Revolution.”</p><p>‍</p><h4>More information:</h4><p>Read our investigation into Star Sapphire Group <a href="../stories/star-sapphire-companies-funnelling-arms-and-money-to-military.html">here</a></p><p>‍</p></div></main></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876/js/webflow.969e6cb1e.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]--></body></html>

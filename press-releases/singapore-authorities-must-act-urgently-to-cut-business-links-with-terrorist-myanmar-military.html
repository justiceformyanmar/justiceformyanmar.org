The conference takes place in Pyin Oo Lwin from October 26-27. </p><p>Lee Kar Heng is the sole proprietor of TBSS Group, a Singapore company that has provided equipment, training and support for the Myanmar military to development its radar capabilities, in partnership with Myanmar military broker Life and Challenge Company Limited. TBSS Group has involved its international partners in supplying equipment and training to the Myanmar military, including Keysight Technologies (USA), SkyRadar (Luxembourg/Germany), Dspnor (Norway) and RFBeam (Switzerland).  </p><p>Recent <a href="https://asean.usmission.gov/telephonic-press-briefing-with-derek-chollet-counselor-of-the-u-s-department-of-state/">engagement</a> with US State Department Counselor Derek Chollet shows Singapore is considering using its financial leverage over the illegal military junta. Justice For Myanmar calls for concrete action now to stop the trade in arms, related materiel, training and support. </p><p><strong>Justice For Myanmar spokesperson Yadanar Maung says:</strong> <em>“It is deplorable that Singapore businesses are aiding the Myanmar military, which is a terrorist entity. Singaporean authorities should take immediate steps to end the use of their territory as the Myanmar military’s international business hub. This criminal military has been terrorising the people of Myanmar as they have continued to courageously resist the military&#x27;s bloody and illegitimate coup attempt for nearly 9 months in the Spring Revolution. In response, the Myanmar military is attacking the people, committing inhumane acts, including deliberate killings, torture and rape. These crimes amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes. As of </em><a href="https://aappb.org/?p=18355"><em>October 23</em></a><em>, 1,196 people have been murdered, including children, and over 9,000 arrested. This is the backdrop in which Lee Kar Heng is speaking on radars and electronic warfare, continuing to pursue his business with war criminals. TBSS Group has also implicated businesses in Europe and the US, which have provided equipment and training. We demand an investigation into whether this training and supply of technology to Myanmar has breached EU or US arms controls. Myanmar arms dealers including Life and Challenge must be designated for targeted sanctions. The Myanmar military is about to commit a new wave of atrocity crimes against people of Chin State and Magway and Sagaing Regions. This yet again shows the urgency of a global arms embargo to end the international flow of arms to Myanmar military terrorists.”</em></p><p>‍</p><h4>Note to editors</h4><p>See Justice For Myanmar’s investigation into Lee Kar Heng and TBSS Group’s business with the Myanmar military here: <a href="../stories/singaporean-radar-engineer-to-speak-at-myanmar-military-science-and-tech-conference-as-military-set-to-launch-catastrophic-anawrahta-operation.html">www.justiceformyanmar.org/stories/singaporean-radar-engineer-to-speak-at-myanmar-military-science-and-tech-conference-as-military-set-to-launch-catastrophic-anawrahta-operation </a></p><p><a href="../index.html">Justice For Myanmar</a>, a group of covert activists campaigning for justice and accountability for the people of Myanmar, is calling for an end to military business and for federal democracy and a sustainable peace.</p><p>ENDS</p><p>For more information please contact: </p><p>Yadanar Maung </p><p>Email: <a href="mailto:media@justiceformyanmar.org">media@justiceformyanmar.org</a> </p><p>Website: <a href="../index.html">https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/</a> </p><p>Mirror: <a href="https://justiceformyanmar.github.io/justiceformyanmar.org/">https://justiceformyanmar.github.io/justiceformyanmar.org/</a> </p><p>Twitter: @justicemyanmar </p><p>Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/justiceformyanmar.org/">https://www.facebook.com/justiceformyanmar.org/</a></p><p>‍</p></div></main></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876/js/webflow.d17b4d4a6.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]--></body></html>

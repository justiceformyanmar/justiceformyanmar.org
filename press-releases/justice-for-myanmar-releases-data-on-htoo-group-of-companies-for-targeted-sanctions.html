On September 2, 2021, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-dominic-raab-announces-new-myanmar-sanctions#:~:text=Foreign%20Secretary%20Dominic%20Raab%20has,his%20business%20empire%20Htoo%20Group.&amp;text=Enforced%20with%20immediate%20effect%2C%20sanctions,tycoon%20from%20entering%20the%20UK.">UK government</a> imposed targeted sanctions against HGC and its chairperson, Tay Za, citing the group’s provision of financial support and arms to the Myanmar military. HGC responded with a <a href="https://htoo.com/press-release-on-uk-sanctions-on-htoo-group-of-companies-and-its-founder-mr-u-tay-za/">press release </a>on September 6, 2021, stating that they disagree with the sanctions designation and advised that they are seeking clarification “as there is no actionable data or detailed information”. </p><p>To advocate for further sanctions against Tay Za and HGC, and to support sanctions enforcement, Justice For Myanmar has published data on Tay Za’s business network and links to the Myanmar military and its junta. This includes a leaked <a href="https://jfm-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/(23.4.2018)YAECO+A-319+_+ATR-72(+Meeting+_+Notesheet).pdf">meeting note sheet </a>on business between the Myanmar Air Force and Yangon Aircraft Engineering Company Limited that provides further evidence of Tay Za’s involvement in the arms trade, as well as a <a href="https://jfm-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/Htoo%2BGroup%2Bbusinesses%2Band%2Bindividuals%2Bfor%2Btargeted%2Bsanctions.xlsx">spreadsheet</a> detailing 131 directors and shareholders of 60 HGC subsidiaries and associated businesses.</p><p><strong>Justice For Myanmar spokesperson Yadanar Maung says:</strong> <em>“Tay Za and his network are close and longstanding business partners of the Myanmar military and have built immense wealth from the military’s systemic corruption. They stand complicit in the military’s ongoing atrocity crimes through their business with the junta and its conglomerates, including concessions, a joint venture, land leases and the sale of arms and related services. The illegitimate military junta is continuing its campaign of terror across Myanmar, murdering more than 1,100 and arresting more than 8,000 including children, committing torture, sexual violence, mass killings, looting and destroying properties, attacking medical workers and blocking humanitarian aid. Over 250,000 people have been forced to flee from the junta’s indiscriminate aerial assaults, shelling and mortar attacks and ground clearance operations in ethnic areas. These international crimes are enabled by Htoo Group and other crony conglomerates. We demand the international community act now to impose further sanctions against Tay Za, his family members and their businesses, as well as all other business associates of the Myanmar military. The international community must act to support the Myanmar people’s struggle for federal democracy and send a clear message that the criminal conduct of the military junta and its cronies will no longer be tolerated.”</em></p><p>‍</p><h4>Note to editors</h4><p>See Justice For Myanmar’s page on Htoo Group and its business with the Myanmar military: <a href="../stories/htoo-groups-business-with-the-myanmar-military.html">www.justiceformyanmar.org/stories/htoo-groups-business-with-the-myanmar-military</a> </p><p>See Justice For Myanmar’s list of military-owned businesses, directors and significant business associates that require targeted international sanctions here: <a href="../stories/myanmar-military-controlled-businesses-associates-that-require-targeted-sanctions.html">www.justiceformyanmar.org/stories/myanmar-military-controlled-businesses-associates-that-require-targeted-sanctions </a></p><p><a href="../index.html">Justice For Myanmar</a>, a group of covert activists campaigning for justice and accountability for the people of Myanmar, is calling for an end to military business and for federal democracy and a sustainable peace.</p><p>ENDS</p><p>For more information please contact: </p><p>Yadanar Maung </p><p>Email: <a href="mailto:media@justiceformyanmar.org">media@justiceformyanmar.org</a> </p><p>Website: <a href="../index.html">https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/ </a></p><p>Mirror: <a href="https://justiceformyanmar.github.io/justiceformyanmar.org/">https://justiceformyanmar.github.io/justiceformyanmar.org/</a> </p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://www.twitter.com/justicemyanmar">@justicemyanmar</a> </p><p>Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/justiceformyanmar.org/">https://www.facebook.com/justiceformyanmar.org/</a></p><p>‍</p></div></main></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876/js/webflow.f83fcfd71.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]--></body></html>

The feature uses newly leaked documents, which were shared with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/24/world/asia/myanmar-coup-military-tatmadaw-kyaw-thaung.html?">New York Times</a>.</p><p>The two connected business groups are owned by descendants of the deceased crony Kyaw Thaung, and have a combined network of 28 subsidiaries and associated businesses in Myanmar and Singapore, including with the Myanmar military and its conglomerates.</p><p>Jonathan Myo Kyaw Thaung, who heads KT Group, has a close relationship with junta chief and war criminal Min Aung Hlaing, as well as with crony Aung Ko Win, who heads KBZ Group, according to sources with knowledge of the business.</p><p>KT Group and Ky-Tha Group businesses are involved in arms brokerage and technical support for the Myanmar military, including a Ky-Tha deal with French corporation Thales for coastal surveillance radar, and KT Group has procured airplanes for the Myanmar military. KT Group also hold land leases with the military and its conglomerates, and made financial donations to the Myanmar military in 2017 that supported the genocide against Rohingya.</p><p>Justice For Myanmar demands immediate sanctions against KT Group and Ky-Tha businesses, directors and shareholders. </p><p><strong>Justice For Myanmar spokesperson Yadanar Maung says: </strong><em>“The Kyaw Thaung family’s conglomerates are a source of revenue and arms for the Myanmar military junta, which is a terrorist organisation. Jonathan Kyaw Thaung even has a direct personal relationship with war criminal Min Aung Hlaing, who is responsible for the murder of over 1300 people since the illegal attempted coup, and is intensifying his campaign of terror across Myanmar. The Myanmar military and its cronies must not be allowed to continue business as usual. We demand immediate sanctions against the Kyaw Thaung family businesses to prevent the junta’s access to funds and arms.”</em></p><p>‍</p><h4>Note to editors</h4><p>See our feature on the Kyaw Thaung family’s business with the Myanmar military here: <a href="../stories/the-kyaw-thaung-familys-business-with-the-myanmar-military.html">https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/stories/the-kyaw-thaung-familys-business-with-the-myanmar-military</a></p><p>See the New York Times investigation into the Kyaw Thaung family business here: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/24/world/asia/myanmar-coup-military-tatmadaw-kyaw-thaung.html?">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/24/world/asia/myanmar-coup-military-tatmadaw-kyaw-thaung.html?</a></p><p><a href="../index.html">Justice For Myanmar</a>, a group of covert activists campaigning for justice and accountability for the people of Myanmar, is calling for an end to military business and for federal democracy and a sustainable peace.</p><p>ENDS</p><p>For more information please contact: </p><p>Yadanar Maung </p><p>Email: <a href="mailto:media@justiceformyanmar.org">media@justiceformyanmar.org</a> </p><p>Website: <a href="../index.html">https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/</a> </p><p>Mirror: <a href="https://justiceformyanmar.github.io/justiceformyanmar.org/">https://justiceformyanmar.github.io/justiceformyanmar.org/</a> </p><p>Twitter: @justicemyanmar </p><p>Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/justiceformyanmar.org/">https://www.facebook.com/justiceformyanmar.org/</a></p><p>‍</p></div></main></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876/js/webflow.703cb6e99.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]--></body></html>

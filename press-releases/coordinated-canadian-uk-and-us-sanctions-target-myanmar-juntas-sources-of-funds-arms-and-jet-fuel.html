For Myanmar welcomes the latest round of targeted sanctions imposed against the illegal Myanmar military junta, its cronies and arms brokers, coordinated between Canada, the UK and USA. </p><p>The sanctions, announced on October 31, 2023, were significant in targeting the junta’s sources of funds, arms, equipment, and jet fuel, but more sanctions and better coordination are needed to disrupt the junta’s ability to continue its campaign of terror against the people of Myanmar. </p><p>Priorities include full sanctions on Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), sanctions on junta-controlled mining enterprises, a ban on the sale of jet fuel to Myanmar, action against banks that the junta uses to channel funds and purchase arms, and coordinated sanctions against whole networks of junta cronies and arms dealers. Details of sanctions targets are on the Justice For Myanmar <a href="https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/">website</a>.</p><p>We remain dismayed at the lack of action by Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea to impose sanctions in response to the military’s coup attempt and ongoing war crimes and crimes against humanity, and urge these countries to act now. Many of the latest sanctions targets maintain business links to Singapore. We call on the Singaporean government to do more to block the junta’s access to funds, arms, equipment and jet fuel. </p><p>Since the military’s illegal coup attempt, more than 4,100 people have been <a href="https://aappb.org/">killed by the junta</a> and over 25,000 arrested. In the face of mass, nationwide resistance to its coup attempt by the people of Myanmar, the junta has intensified indiscriminate aerial attacks, shelling, mass arbitrary arrests, torture, rape, the destruction of whole communities and forced displacement. </p><p>International action needs to be ramped up urgently to stop the junta’s atrocities and support the Myanmar people’s struggle for federal democracy.  </p><p>Sanctions imposed this week that target the junta’s sources of funds, arms, equipment and jet fuel, along with previous designations that remain in force, include: </p><p> </p><p><strong>Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE): </strong>A state-owned enterprise illegally controlled by the junta and targeted by the USA for the first time with a directive against the direct and indirect provision of financial services, which will go into force on December 15. This follows a sustained campaign by Myanmar people, civil society and allies. </p><p>The financial services directive is an important step to disrupt the flow of funds to the junta but falls short of full sanctions that would freeze MOGE’s assets and block all trade with the junta-controlled state-owned enterprise. </p><p>MOGE was previously sanctioned by the EU. <br/><br/><strong>Mining Enterprise No. 1 (ME1) and Mining Enterprise No. 2 (ME2):</strong> State-owned enterprises illegally controlled by the junta and sanctioned by Canada. ME1 and ME2 monopolise the mining sector, receive a share of revenue from private mining companies, and funnel large amounts of revenue to the junta. </p><p>ME1 and ME2 were previously sanctioned by the USA and EU.  </p><p> </p><p><strong>International Group of Entrepreneur Services Company Limited (IGE):</strong> A crony company sanctioned by the UK for its business with the Myanmar military, which is a subsidiary of International Group of Entrepreneur Company Limited. IGE Group is a crony conglomerate led by Ne Aung, the son of former junta minister Aung Thaung and brother of junta navy chief Moe Aung. IGE has deep business links with the military, including through the Lotte Hotel, developed on land leased from the Office of the Quartermaster General of the Myanmar Army, as <a href="https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/stories/myanmar-military-controlled-businesses-associates-that-require-targeted-sanctions">reported</a> by Justice For Myanmar. </p><p>IGE Group has at least three companies that remain registered in Singapore: IGE Pte Ltd, UNOG Pte Ltd and IPL Pte Ltd. </p><p>International Group of Entrepreneur Company Limited was previously sanctioned by the EU. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Shwe Byain Phyu Group and Thein Win Zaw:</strong> Shwe Byain Phyu Group is a crony conglomerate founded by Thein Win Zaw, who is the group’s chairperson. Both were sanctioned by Canada. Shwe Byain Phyu bought Telenor Myanmar, renamed ATOM Myanmar, providing the junta with enhanced surveillance capabilities and access to personal data. Justice For Myanmar has <a href="https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/stories/shwe-byain-phyus-military-links-exposed">exposed</a> the business interests of Shwe Byain Phyu Group and Thein Win Zaw.</p><p>Shwe Byain Phyu has a company in Singapore, Investcom Pte Ltd, which remains registered.  </p><p>Shwe Byain Phyu Group and Thein Win Zaw have been sanctioned for the first time. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Star Sapphire Group of Companies, Star Sapphire Trading Company Limited, Tun Min Latt and Win Min Soe</strong>: All sanctioned by Canada, the group has multiple businesses that generate funds for the Myanmar military, including a casino, a hotel and mining.

The group is owned by Tun Min Latt and Win Min Soe, who are a married couple and are close associates of junta head Min Aung Hlaing and his children. Tun Min Latt is in custody in Thailand on drug trafficking and money laundering <a href="https://www.occrp.org/ru/daily/16880-arrest-warrant-for-thai-senator-issued-and-quickly-retracted">charges</a>.

The USA also previously sanctioned Star Sapphire Trading Company Limited and Win Min Soe.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Cargo Link Petroleum Logistics Company Limited and Khin Phyu Win:</strong> Cargo Link Petroleum Logistics (formerly Cargo Link Pongrawe Logistics Company Limited), sanctioned by Canada, is part of the Shoon group of companies (formerly Asia Sun). Shoon group is the junta’s main partner in the import, storage and distribution of jet fuel. The group is led by Khin Phyu Win, also sanctioned by Canada. Cargo Link Petroleum Logistics is the junta’s main transporter of jet fuel to military bases and airports across Myanmar. The role of Cargo Link Petroleum Logistics and Khin Phyu Win in supply jet fuel to the Myanmar military has been exposed by <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2022/11/myanmar-the-supply-chain-fueling-war-crimes/">Amnesty International</a> and <a href="https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/stories/myanmar-military-jet-fuel-companies-for-targeted-sanctions">Justice For Myanmar</a>. </p><p>Shoon group has three companies that remain registered in Singapore: Shoon Energy Pte Ltd, P.E.I. Energy Pte Ltd and PEIA Pte Ltd.  </p><p>Cargo Link Petroleum Logistics was previously sanctioned by the US, and its parent company, Cargo Link Company Limited, was previously sanctioned by the UK. Khin Phyu Win was previously sanctioned by the USA and UK. </p><p>Canada continues to lead in measures to stop the junta’s access to jet fuel, which it needs to continue to carry out indiscriminate airstrikes. On October 31, Canada expanded its ban on the sale of jet fuel to include a prohibition on shipping insurance for the transport of jet fuel to Myanmar. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Sky Aviator Company Limited, Heli Eagle Company Limited, Sky Royal Hero Limited, Kyaw Min Oo and Myo Min Oo:</strong> Major suppliers of aviation equipment to the Myanmar military and all sanctioned by Canada, Sky Aviator is owned by Kyaw Min Oo and the linked company, Heli Eagle, is owned by Myo Min Oo, who is his brother, according to Justice For Myanmar sources.

The <a href="https://www.myanmarwitness.org/reports/arms-investigation-russian-yak-130-aircraft-in-myanmar" target="_self">Yak-130</a> is increasingly deployed by the military within populated areas, including in the catastrophic <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mohrmyanmar/posts/pfbid0tMqm3bQGnyPLiw6izS5AVjtHwhJQ115V8MqEfJhpnN1oGJrieBDQkQvWEccp58Q1l">indiscriminate bombing</a> of Pazigyi village, Kantabulu township, Sagaing Region, killing at least 168 people, including children, in the deadliest airstrike since the military’s attempted coup. Sky Aviator’s business with the Myanmar military has been exposed by <a href="https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/stories/exposed-companies-brokering-arms-equipment-to-myanmar-military">Justice For Myanmar</a> and the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/countries/myanmar/crp-sr-myanmar-2023-05-17.pdf">UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar</a>.</p><p>Heli Eagle and Sky Royal Hero have supplied equipment to the Myanmar military following the coup attempt, according to the UN Special Rapporteur on Myanmar.

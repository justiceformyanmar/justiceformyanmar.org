This followed a shipment of 1,000 fuzes in 2020 and 5 fuzes in 2019. </p><p>While the records of two later shipments did not specify the type of fuzes, the 2019 shipment was of time mechanical fuze 447, designed for 84mm Carl Gustaf recoilless rifles. </p><p>The Myanmar military has <a href="https://karennews.org/2022/04/burma-army-used-swedish-made-shells-when-attacking-karen-joint-forces/">used</a> 84mm Carl Gustaf rounds during attacks in ethnic areas. </p><p>Saab Group, a Swedish corporation that manufactures Carl Gustaf launchers and munitions, did not respond to questions from Justice For Myanmar regarding licencing of fuzes to India’s Ordnance Factory Board and the Sandeep Metalcraft shipments to Myanmar.</p><p>The fuzes were sent to the private Myanmar military supplier, Creative Exploration Ltd, formerly named mySpace International.</p><p>Creative Exploration is a major broker of arms and equipment for the Myanmar Police Force.</p><p>The company is owned by Dr Kyaw Kyaw Htun and his wife, Zar Phyu Tin Soe, the daughter of a former military officer who was Myanmar’s ambassador to Russia. Kyaw Kyaw Htun is a former military officer and graduate of the Defence Services Technological Academy.</p><p>Since 2020, Creative Exploration has also imported US digital forensics technology from the US company, Oxygen Forensics, and a digital forensics examination station from the US firm Sirichie, both via Indian suppliers. </p><p>Justice For Myanmar calls on India to impose an immediate arms embargo on the Myanmar military. </p><p>Sweden must suspend exports and licence production agreements with Indian arms manufacturers for launchers and munitions, and investigate if any of the Sandeep Metalcraft shipments to Myanmar contain Swedish technology.</p><p>Fellow members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad), Australia, Japan and the USA, must use their influence to stop the flow of arms from India to the Myanmar military. </p><p>Sanctions must urgently be imposed on Creative Exploration, Sandeep Metalcraft, their owners and all other Myanmar military arms suppliers. </p><p><strong>Justice For Myanmar spokesperson Yadanar Maung says: </strong>“India’s supply of fuzes to the Myanmar military is inexcusable.  </p><p>“India is directly supporting the junta’s indiscriminate attacks against civilians by allowing the export of key components in the very weapons the military is using to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity. </p><p>“The junta has used airstrikes and shelling to bomb homes and villages, kill and maim people and forcibly displace an estimated 690,000, in a nationwide campaign of terror.  </p><p>“As a democratic country and a neighbour of Myanmar, we appeal to the Indian government to stand with the people of Myanmar, not war criminals and their illegitimate junta.  </p><p>“We call on India to impose an immediate arms embargo on the Myanmar military and end complicity in the junta’s atrocity crimes.</p><p>“It is deeply concerning that a Swedish company may be tied to the provision of weapons that are killing innocent people in Myanmar </p><p>“We demand Sweden immediately suspend exports and licencing of launchers and munitions until India stops the flow of arms to the terrorist junta.”</p><p> <strong> </strong></p><p><strong>More information:</strong></p><p>Read our investigation, <a href="../stories/india-supplying-fuzes-to-myanmar-military-deepening-complicity-in-its-atrocity-crimes.html">India supplying fuzes to Myanmar military, deepening complicity in its atrocity crimes</a></p></div></main></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876/js/webflow.969e6cb1e.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]--></body></html>

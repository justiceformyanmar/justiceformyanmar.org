These must be cut to end the military’s campaign of terror. </p><p>All arms brokers and suppliers must be sanctioned, including Miya Win International, Dynasty International, and their related companies. </p><p>Despite the EU arms embargo, companies from member states including Austria and Germany have sold arms and equipment to the Myanmar military, following the Rohingya genocide and after the attempted coup. </p><p>The EU and its member states must urgently act to strengthen and enforce the arms embargo and make sure no businesses in their territory remain complicit with the terrorist junta. </p><p>Those who have violated the arms embargo must be held accountable.”</p><p> </p><h4>More information:</h4><p>Access the full Miya Win International feature on the <a href="../stories/myanmar-military-arms-broker-supplied-uav-parts-from-austria-since-coup-attempt.html">JFM website</a></p><p>See our feature on Dynasty International <a href="../stories/arms-broker-with-links-to-belarus-russia-and-germany-supplied-myanmar-junta-since-coup-attempt.html">here</a></p><p>‍</p></div></main></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876/js/webflow.703cb6e99.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]--></body></html>

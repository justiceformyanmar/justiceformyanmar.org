However, it has failed to follow this up with targeted sanctions beyond a travel ban imposed on five senior junta officials. This is not good enough. </p><p>“Faced with horrific atrocities, the people of Myanmar continue to sacrifice their lives for federal democracy and peace. The international community must listen to their voices and act in solidarity.”</p><p><strong>More information:</strong></p><p>View Justice For Myanmar’s <a href="../stories/what-has-been-done-to-stop-the-myanmar-militarys-atrocity-crimes.html">comparative data on sanctions</a></p><p>View Justice For Myanmar’s list of <a href="../stories/myanmar-military-controlled-businesses-associates-that-require-targeted-sanctions.html">Myanmar military-controlled businesses and associates that require targeted sanctions</a></p><p><strong>Justice For Myanmar</strong> | <a href="mailto:media@justiceformyanmar.org">media@justiceformyanmar.org</a> </p><p><a href="../index.html">https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/</a> | Mirror: <a href="https://justiceformyanmar.github.io/justiceformyanmar.org/">https://justiceformyanmar.github.io/justiceformyanmar.org/</a></p><p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/justicemyanmar">https://www.twitter.com/justicemyanmar</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/justiceformyanmar.org/">https://www.facebook.com/justiceformyanmar.org/</a> </p><p><a href="../index.html">Justice For Myanmar</a>, a group of covert activists campaigning for justice and accountability for the people of Myanmar, is calling for an end to military business and for federal democracy and a sustainable peace.</p></div></main></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876/js/webflow.703cb6e99.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]--></body></html>

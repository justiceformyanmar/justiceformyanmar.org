Myanmar arms brokers typically use Singapore to facilitate payments between the Myanmar military and international arms suppliers.  </p><p>Among them, <strong>Dr Naing Htut Aung</strong> is a central figure in Myanmar’s arms trade who facilitates air force and navy contracts with suppliers, notably in China.</p><p>He is linked to top-level military leaders, including current Commander-in-Chief and war criminal, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.</p><p>The Ministry of Commerce of Myanmar’s National Unity Government listed Dr Naing Htut Aung and IGG in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mocNUGMyan/photos/pcb.323729522966288/323729479632959/">statement</a> on January 25 for brokering weapons for the terrorist junta.</p><p>Another significant company, <strong>Myanmar Consultancy Company Limited</strong>, has supplied parts to the Myanmar military after the attempted coup, according to records from the shipping database, ImportGenius. </p><p>‍</p><h4>Further sanctions needed</h4><p><strong>Justice For Myanmar spokesperson Yadanar Maung comments: </strong>“February 1 marked one year since the Myanmar military launched its bloody coup attempt. Over the past year, Myanmar’s military has <a href="https://aappb.org/">killed over 1,500 unarmed civilians and arrested over 11,000 more</a>.” </p><p>“The junta is continuing its terror campaign with indiscriminate airstrikes, shelling, forced displacement and rape. </p><p>“More than 400,000 civilians have forcibly displaced since the military’s coup attempt, according to <a href="https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Myanmar Emergency Update - 19 January 2022.pdf">UNHCR</a>. </p><p>“The junta has been destroying and blocking humanitarian emergency aid to vulnerable populations and attacking medical and aid workers. </p><p>“These crimes are enabled by the continued supply of arms from companies like International Gateways Group and Myanmar Consultancy Company.</p><p>“Justice For Myanmar calls on governments around the world to urgently place targeted sanctions on the companies and individuals who are providing arms to the military, and are thereby complicit in the continued attacks on the people of Myanmar. </p><p>“There must be an immediate global arms embargo to stop the flow of arms to the terrorist junta.</p><p>“Singapore continues to allow known arms traders to use its territory to aid and abet the Myanmar military’s atrocities. Singapore must ends its role as a hub for Myanmar military procurement.”</p><p>‍</p><h4>More information: </h4><p>Access the full story including leaked documents, companies and individuals targeted for sanctions <a href="../stories/military-linked-companies-procured-usd-millions-in-arms-and-military-equipment.html">here</a>. </p><p><strong>Yadanar Maung</strong> | Justice For Myanmar | <a href="mailto:mailto:media@justiceformyanmar.org">media@justiceformyanmar.org</a> </p><p><a href="../index.html">https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/</a> | Mirror: <a href="../index.html">https://justiceformyanmar.github.io/justiceformyanmar.org/</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/justicemyanmar">https://twitter.com/justicemyanmar</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/justiceformyanmar.org/">https://www.facebook.com/justiceformyanmar.org/</a> </p><p><a href="../index.html">Justice For Myanmar</a>, a group of covert activists campaigning for justice and accountability for the people of Myanmar, is calling for an end to military business and for federal democracy and a sustainable peace.</p></div></main></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876/js/webflow.969e6cb1e.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]--></body></html>

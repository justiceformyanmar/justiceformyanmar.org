Of the intended 16 members of the illegitimate SAC ruling apparatus, eight are serving members of the Myanmar military. </p><p>Utilising Union Election Commission voter list data from Anawratha ward of Zeyathiri township, our research uncovered the dates of birth and national registration card numbers for all 8 members of the SAC with military backgrounds, 22 of their immediate family members, 17 of their businesses and 23 of their business associates. Given the opaqueness of the Myanmar military and their business interests, this list cannot be considered complete. All other members of the military regime must also be sanctioned.</p><p><strong>Yadanar Maung, Justice For Myanmar spokesperson says: </strong><em>“The families of senior generals are key beneficiaries of the systemic corruption of military rule. The Myanmar military’s despicable and illegal conduct, including their illegitimate February 1 coup, is enabled by their business interests. The Myanmar military leadership uses business to enrich themselves at the expense of the Myanmar people and finance their brutal campaigns of repression against the Myanmar people. We call on the international community to take immediate and decisive action to stand with the people of Myanmar and demonstrate that the coup is unacceptable. Impose targeted sanctions on the military regime leadership, their family members, military-owned business and their business associates.”</em></p><h4>Note to editors</h4><p>See Justice For Myanmar’s list of military members of the State Administrative Council, their immediate family members, their businesses and business associates here: <a href="../stories/myanmar-military-sac-members-their-businesses-and-associates-that-require-targeted-sanctions.html">https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/stories/myanmar-military-sac-members-their-businesses-and-associates-that-require-targeted-sanctions </a></p><p>See Justice For Myanmar’s list of military-owned businesses, directors and significant business associates that require targeted international sanctions here: <a href="../stories/myanmar-military-controlled-businesses-associates-that-require-targeted-sanctions.html">www.justiceformyanmar.org/stories/myanmar-military-controlled-businesses-associates-that-require-targeted-sanctions </a></p><p><a href="../index.html">Justice For Myanmar,</a> a group of covert activists campaigning for justice and accountability for the people of Myanmar, is calling for an end to military business and for federal democracy and a sustainable peace.</p><p>ENDS</p><p><strong>For more information please contact: </strong></p><p>Yadanar Maung </p><p>Email: <a href="mailto:media@justiceformyanmar.org">media@justiceformyanmar.org</a> </p><p>Website: <a href="../index.html">https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/ </a></p><p>Mirror: <a href="https://justiceformyanmar.github.io/justiceformyanmar.org/">https://justiceformyanmar.github.io/justiceformyanmar.org/ </a></p><p>Twitter: @justicemyanmar </p><p>Facebook:<a href="https://www.facebook.com/justiceformyanmar.org/"> https://www.facebook.com/justiceformyanmar.org/</a></p><p>‍</p></div></main></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876/js/webflow.f83fcfd71.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]--></body></html>

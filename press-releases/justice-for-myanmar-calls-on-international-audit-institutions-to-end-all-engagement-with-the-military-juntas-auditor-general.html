Therefore the EU does not plan participation in ASEANSAI events or support to ASEANSAI while the Myanmar military junta is included.”</p><p><strong>Justice For Myanmar spokesperson Yadanar Maung says:</strong> <em>“The Myanmar military junta is a terrorist organisation that is carrying out mass killings, rape and torture with total impunity. </em></p><p><em>“Engagement and support for the junta’s auditor general has emboldened the junta’s terror campaign and provided legitimacy that the junta is desperately seeking. </em></p><p><em>“ASEANSAI and its member states have failed to uphold human rights and respect the will of Myanmar people by recognising the junta’s auditor general and allowing him to assume leadership. </em></p><p><em>“INTOSAI has also deplorably failed to respect human rights and the principle of independence of supreme audit institutions by formally recognising the junta. </em></p><p><em>“We call on ASEANSAI and INTOSAI to immediately cease recognition of the Myanmar military junta and bar its representatives from participation in all events. </em></p><p><em>“We welcome the EU’s position to not participate in, or support, ASEANSAI while it is under the leadership of the Myanmar military junta. Norway and Sweden must follow the EU’s lead and end all contact with the illegal junta, including its auditor general.”</em></p><p>‍</p><h4>Note to editors</h4><p>See Justice For Myanmar’s investigation into international audit institutions legitimising the Myanmar military junta here: <a href="../stories/international-audit-institutions-are-legitimising-the-illegal-myanmar-military-junta.html">www.justiceformyanmar.org/stories/international-audit-institutions-are-legitimising-the-illegal-myanmar-military-junta</a> </p><p><a href="../index.html">Justice For Myanmar</a>, a group of covert activists campaigning for justice and accountability for the people of Myanmar, is calling for an end to military business and for federal democracy and a sustainable peace.</p><p>ENDS</p><p>For more information please contact: </p><p>Yadanar Maung </p><p>Email: <a href="mailto:media@justiceformyanmar.org">media@justiceformyanmar.org</a> </p><p>Website: <a href="../index.html">https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/</a> </p><p>Mirror: <a href="https://justiceformyanmar.github.io/justiceformyanmar.org/">https://justiceformyanmar.github.io/justiceformyanmar.org/</a> </p><p>Twitter: @justicemyanmar </p><p>Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/justiceformyanmar.org/">https://www.facebook.com/justiceformyanmar.org/</a></p></div></main></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876/js/webflow.969e6cb1e.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]--></body></html>

We call for the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution to consolidate international action to stop the military’s violent assault against the people of Myanmar. The UN Security Council must also impose a global arms embargo to stop the flow of weapons and dual-use goods to the Myanmar military junta.</p><p>It has been nine months since the attempted coup by the brutal Myanmar military. 1,236 people have been killed and 9,667 arbitrarily detained as of 3 November, 2021. The junta has continued its violent assault throughout Myanmar, recently deployed troops and increased its attacks against civilians in Chin State, Sagaing and Magwe Regions in north-western Myanmar, while continuing its attacks in Karenni, Karen and Shan States.</p><p>On Friday 29 October, the Myanmar military began <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/army-shelling-in-myanmar-blamed-for-setting-160-homes-ablaze/2021/10/30/c4367de0-397a-11ec-9662-399cfa75efee_story.html">shelling</a> the town of Thantlang in Western Chin State, setting as many as 200 houses and at least two churches on fire. Soldiers also deliberately torched houses at random.</p><p>Save the Children – whose office in Thantlang was set on fire alongside local civil society organizations including Chin Human Rights Organization – strongly <a href="https://www.savethechildren.net/news/myanmar-save-children-office-destroyed-fire-amid-violent-clashes">condemned</a> the recent attacks stating “the incident is further evidence of a deepening crisis in Myanmar” as the violence continues to affect large numbers of children across the country. Such indiscriminate attacks against civilians and humanitarian organizations are violations of international law and constitute war crimes.</p><p>Following the 1 February attempted coup, Chin State has been at the forefront of some of the strongest resistance to the Myanmar military junta. This has been met with fierce attacks by the military, including use of fighter jets and heavy artillery used against civilians while hundreds have been arbitrarily detained, and dozens killed. Prior to this most recent attack, approximately 10,000 residents had already fled Thantlang as the military junta indiscriminately shot into homes and set off fires by shelling in September. At the time, a Christian pastor who was attempting to put out the fires was shot dead, and his ring finger cruelly cut off and removed, along with his wedding ring. Those displaced have taken shelter in nearby villages and others have sought refuge in India. Many of those who have been displaced have been unable to access humanitarian aid as the junta weaponizes aid for their own political benefit, often blocking access or destroying it in an effort to weaken the resistance.</p><p>In early October, amid increasing deployment of heavy weapons and troops by the military junta, the spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=27631&amp;LangID=E">urged</a> “the international community to speak with one voice, to prevent the commission of further serious human rights violations against the people of Myanmar.” The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights also warned of greater human rights catastrophe and further mass atrocity crimes amid the deployment of tens of thousands of troops stating, “These tactics are ominously reminiscent of those employed by the military before its genocidal attacks against the Rohingya in Rakhine State in 2016 and 2017.” Echoing these concerns, 29 Rohingya organizations have <a href="https://www.brouk.org.uk/rohingya-cautions-un-security-council-over-chin-crisis-do-not-repeat-mistake-in-failing-to-act/">urged</a> the Council not to repeat the mistakes it made in 2017 by failing to act on warnings of an impending military offensive against the Rohingya.</p><p>Since the start of the attempted coup nine months ago, hundreds of Myanmar and international society organizations have repeatedly and vehemently <a href="https://burmacampaign.org.uk/unsc-must-meet-regarding-north-western-burma-crisis/">called</a> for the UN Security Council to act. This includes a statement from 92 Chin civil society organizations and Burma Campaign UK, who have called on the UK as the “penholder” of Myanmar at the UN Security Council to urgently act. The Special Advisory Council for Myanmar have also <a href="https://specialadvisorycouncil.org/2021/10/we-will-either-die-of-starvation-or-die-fighting-un-security-council-must-act-on-myanmar/">called</a> for the UN Security Council to “issue a resolution to consolidate international action towards resolving the crisis.”</p><p>Yet, the Security Council has failed to take any effective actions beyond statements. As the offensives escalate in Chin State, the UN Security Council must act before it is too late. It must convene an urgent meeting on the escalating attacks in Chin State and the overall deepening political, human rights and humanitarian crisis as a result of the Myanmar military leaders search for power and greed that has caused immense suffering. The human security risk not only threatens the people of Myanmar but also regional and thus global security and peace. The Council must immediately build on previous statements with concrete action by adopting a resolution that consolidates international action to resolve the deepening crisis, a global arms embargo to stop the flow of weapons, including dual-use goods, and refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court. The Council must demonstrate that it will take concrete actions to stop the junta from committing further atrocity crimes and posing further risk to human security of the people of Myanmar.</p><p>The UN must not continue to fail the people of Myanmar.</p><p><strong>For more information, please contact:</strong></p><p>Khin Ohmar, Progressive Voice, <a href="mailto:info@progressive-voice.org">info@progressive-voice.org</a><br/>Salai Za Uk, Chin Human Rights Organization, <a href="mailto:info@chinhumanrights.org">info@chinhumanrights.org</a><br/>Tun Khin, Burmese Rohingya Organization UK, <a href="mailto:tunkhin80@gmail.com">tunkhin80@gmail.com</a><br/>‍</p><p><strong>Signed by 521 Myanmar, regional and international civil society organizations* including:</strong></p><p>8888 Generation (New Zealand)<br/>Action Committee for Democracy Development<br/>African Great Lakes Action Network<br/>All Burma Democratic Face in New Zealand<br/>All Burma IT Student Union<br/>Alternative Solutions for Rural Communities (ASORCOM)<br/>ALTSEAN-Burma<br/>America Rohingya Justice Network<br/>American Baptist Churches USA<br/>American Rohingya Advocacy<br/>Ananda Data<br/>Anti-Dictatorship in Burma – DC Metropolitan Area<br/>Arakan CSO Network<br/>Arakan Institute for Peace and Development<br/>Arakan Rohingya Development Association – Australia<br/>Arakan Rohingya National Organisation (ARNO)<br/>Arakan Rohingya Union<br/>Arizona Kachin Community<br/>ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR)<br/>Asho University Students Association (AUSA)<br/>Asho Youth Organization<br/>Asian Dignity Initiative<br/>Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (FORUM-ASIA)<br/>Asian Resource Foundation<br/>Asia-Pacific Solidarity Coalition<br/>Assistance Association for Political Prisoners<br/>Association of Human Rights Defenders and Promoters<br/>Association of Women for Awareness &amp;

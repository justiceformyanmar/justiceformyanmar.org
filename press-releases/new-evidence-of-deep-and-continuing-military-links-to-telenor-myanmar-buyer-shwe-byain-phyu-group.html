MEC is sanctioned in the EU, UK and US. </p><p>In 2017-18, the most recent data available, Shwe Byain Phyu group held jade mining licences under joint ventures with Myanma Gems Enterprise (MGE), a state-owned enterprise now under junta control. </p><p>Shwe Byain Phyu group director Tin Latt Min, wife of Thein Win Zaw, is a director of <strong>Mineral Development Bank</strong>, which provides loans for jade and gems businesses. The bank is continuing to provide international banking services for a sector controlled by MGE, and there is a high risk the bank could violate sanctions.

Htoo Group is sanctioned in the UK. </p><p>Tin Latt Min is a shareholder in <strong>Forest Products Joint Venture Corporation (FPJVC)</strong>, a timber company controlled by the military junta. FPJVC is sanctioned in the EU. </p><p><strong>Justice For Myanmar spokesperson Yadanar Maung says:</strong> “Shwe Byain Phyu is a conglomerate with deep and longstanding ties to the Myanmar military, including with the previous military junta, military conglomerates and sanctioned entities and individuals. </p><p>“The Norwegian government has been turning a blind eye as Telenor Group, a company they control, proceeds to transfer Telenor Myanmar to Shwe Byain Phyu, together with the historical metadata of more than 18 million people. </p><p>“This could amount to complicity in crimes against humanity, by handing the military a potent weapon they can use to track down, arrest, torture and murder civil society activists and journalists. </p><p>“The grave risks that the sale of Telenor Myanmar poses to the lives of Myanmar people are glaringly clear. </p><p>“Telenor must stop fabricating a narrative about how their current course of action is based on human rights considerations and immediately suspend the sale”</p><p> </p><h4>More information:</h4><p>Access the full story <a href="../stories/shwe-byain-phyus-military-links-exposed.html">here</a></p><p><strong>Yadanar Maung</strong> | Justice For Myanmar | <a href="mailto:mailto:media@justiceformyanmar.org"><strong>media@justiceformyanmar.org</strong></a></p><p><a href="../index.html"><strong>https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/</strong></a> | Mirror: <a href="../index.html"><strong>https://justiceformyanmar.github.io/justiceformyanmar.org/</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/justicemyanmar"><strong>https://twitter.com/justicemyanmar</strong></a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/justiceformyanmar.org/"><strong>https://www.facebook.com/justiceformyanmar.org/</strong></a></p><p><a href="../index.html"><strong>Justice For Myanmar</strong></a>, a group of covert activists campaigning for justice and accountability for the people of Myanmar, is calling for an end to military business and for federal democracy and a sustainable peace.</p></div></main></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876/js/webflow.969e6cb1e.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]--></body></html>

Justice For Myanmar calls on all businesses that have commercial relationships with state entities to cut ties. </p><p>Our research has uncovered 133 businesses fully or partially controlled by the Myanmar military, 174 directors of those business, 112 businesses from which the military derive significant income. Our list also includes 32 state-owned enterprises that were formally under civilian ministries, and which are now controlled by the Myanmar military. </p><p><strong>Yadanar Maung, Justice For Myanmar spokesperson says: </strong><em>“The Myanmar military’s despicable and illegal conduct, including their brutal and illegitimate Feb 1 coup, is enabled by their business interests. The Myanmar military leadership uses business to enrich themselves at the expense of the Myanmar people and finance their brutal campaigns of repression against the Myanmar people. This coup was enabled by international businesses like Kirin Holdings, POSCO, Viettel and NORINCO and they remain responsible for our suffering under the new military junta. Without definitive action now, the military will inflict more violence against the people and democracy will not have a chance.” </em></p><p>Justice For Myanmar has named Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) and mobile telecommunications operator MPT. MOGE is now Myanmar’s most lucrative military-owned business, holding production sharing contracts with leading international oil and gas companies including TOTAL, Chevron and POSCO. MTP is jointly operated with Japanese businesses KDDI and Sumitomo Corporation. </p><p><strong>Yadanar Maung continues:</strong> “International business that continues to operate in Myanmar after Feb 1 is bankrolling the Myanmar military and enabling their criminal conduct. We call on all businesses to sever their relationships. In the dark days of the former military dictatorship, their brutal rule was bankrolled by oil and gas money from TOTAL in particular. The international community must not allow that to happen again. As the military regime attempts to silence the people and crush dissent, KDDI and Sumitomo have a special responsibility to end their complicity with these shocking human rights violations against our people.&quot;  </p><p>Note to editors</p><p>See Justice For Myanmar’s list of military-owned businesses, directors and significant business associates that require targeted international sanctions here: <a href="../stories/myanmar-military-controlled-businesses-associates-that-require-targeted-sanctions.html">www.justiceformyanmar.org/stories/myanmar-military-controlled-businesses-associates-that-require-targeted-sanctions </a></p><p><a href="../index.html">Justice For Myanmar</a>, a group of covert activists campaigning for justice and accountability for the people of Myanmar, is calling for an end to military business and for federal democracy and a sustainable peace.</p><p>For the governance structure of military conglomerates, including the public positions of the directors of military businesses, see: The <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/FFM-Myanmar/EconomicInterestsMyanmarMilitary/A_HRC_42_CRP_3.pdf">UN Fact-Finding Mission report</a>: <em>The Economic Interests of the Myanmar Military</em>.</p><p>ENDS</p><p><strong>For more information please contact: </strong></p><p>Yadanar Maung </p><p>Email: media@justiceformyanmar.org </p><p>Website: https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/ </p><p>Mirror: https://justiceformyanmar.github.io/justiceformyanmar.org/ </p><p>Twitter: @justicemyanmar </p><p>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/justiceformyanmar.org/</p></div></main></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876/js/webflow.b418536c3.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]--></body></html>

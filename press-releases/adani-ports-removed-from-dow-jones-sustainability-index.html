This is not a risk worth taking.”<br/>‍<br/><strong>Justice For Myanmar spokesperson Yadanar Maung says,</strong> “S&amp;P’s decision gives a clear signal that doing business with the Myanmar military, which has murdered more than 700 people since the February 1 military coup, cannot be whitewashed as “sustainable”. </p><p>“This shows there are commercial consequences for Adani Ports’ and other businesses that continue to disregard human rights responsibilities by financing the Myanmar military. </p><p>“We call on S&amp;P to now delist other businesses on the DJSI that have commercial links and sell technology to the Myanmar military, including Daiwa House Industry, Tokyo Tatemono, AviChina Industry &amp; Technology, and Bharat Electronics Limited.”</p><p>S&amp;P’s announcement comes amid a flood of exits from Adani Ports’ financiers, with at least eight companies either divesting from or banning future investment in Adani Ports recently due to human rights and climate related concerns (see references below). </p><p><strong>Market Forces Campaigner Pablo Brait</strong> welcomed the move from S&amp;P and says it&#x27;s a major red flag to Adani Group’s remaining investors and bankers. </p><p>“Adani Ports and the entire Adani Group are exposing their investors and bankers to serious reputational risks through involvement with a Myanmar military owned company and the Carmichael thermal coal project. If their claims of corporate responsibility are more than greenwash, then companies like BlackRock, Barclays and JP Morgan must immediately cut ties with Adani, as many others already have.</p><p>“The removal of Adani Ports from the Dow Jones Sustainability Index is a signal to the Adani Group that it will be held accountable for its destructive activities. </p><p>“If Adani is genuine about being a good corporate citizen then it must walk away from the Carmichael coal project, cut ties with Myanmar’s murderous generals and clean up the mess it has made at some of its port sites.” Mr Brait concluded.<strong><br/></strong>‍<br/><strong>Media contacts; <br/></strong>‍<br/>Rawan Arraf, ACIJ: +61 (0)450 708 870<br/>Pablo Brait, Market Forces: +61 (0)421 011 182</p><p><br/><strong>Supporting material</strong></p><p>Investor response to Adani Ports’ controversy;<br/>1.

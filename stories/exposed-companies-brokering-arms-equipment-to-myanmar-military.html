class="w-richtext"><p><strong>116 Myanmar and Singapore companies with 255 directors and shareholders have brokered the supply of weapons and other equipment worth many millions in US dollars to the Myanmar military, including since the illegal attempted coup of February 1, 2021. </strong></p><p>The known brokers include 31 companies with 76 directors and shareholders that Justice For Myanmar has identified as suppliers of arms and equipment to the Myanmar military, who have had active business with the military since its coup attempt. These businesses and their directors and shareholders are complicit in the military’s atrocity crimes. Justice For Myanmar calls for urgent sanctions against these companies and individuals.  </p><p>Justice For Myanmar<em> </em>has also identified 27 companies with 51 directors and shareholders that brokered arms and equipment to the Myanmar military since 2017 – the year of the Rohingya genocide, preceding the coup attempt. They have been complicit in the military’s atrocity crimes and must be prevented from pursuing further business with the military. Justice For Myanmar calls for sanctions against these companies and individuals. </p><p>Linked to the total of 78 Myanmar-based companies brokering for the military are at least 38 subsidiary or associated companies in Singapore. </p><p>Singapore has long been a known financial and trade hub for the Myanmar military junta and this poses an imminent threat to the lives of millions of Myanmar people. As a member of ASEAN, Singapore has an important role to play to resolve the Myanmar crisis. It must start by ending its complicity in the junta’s international crimes.</p><p>Myanmar’s military resources have long been used in its campaign of terror against the people of Myanmar, in aggression against ethnic minorities who resisted its attempts to suppress their equal rights in the union. The military has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity with total impunity against ethnic minorities and in 2017, committed genocide against the Rohingya. Since the 1 February 2021 attempted coup, that deliberate violence is directed against people across the country who continue to reject and resist the military’s ongoing attempt to seize power. </p><p>The suppliers of arms to the Myanmar military have had knowledge of the war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed by the brutal military. Those who continue to provide arms are complicit in the military’s atrocity crimes.  </p><p>Since the military’s attempted coup, the military has carried out indiscriminate airstrikes and shelling, murdered villagers, committed rape, destroyed homes and crops, and <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-update-no-20-31-july-2022">forcibly displaced</a> an estimated 866,400 people.  </p><p>Under the <a href="https://thearmstradetreaty.org/">Arms Trade Treaty</a>, to which 111 states are parties, it is prohibited to transfer arms with knowledge they would be used in the commission of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes. The <a href="https://www.wassenaar.org/">Wassenaar Arrangement</a> on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies seeks to prevent the transfer of dual-use goods to countries of concern. 42 states are parties to the Wassenaar Agreement. However, Singapore is not a party to the Arms Trade Treaty or the Wassenaar Arrangement.</p><p>So far, only a few of the companies supplying arms and other products to the military junta have been sanctioned, while the vast majority are continuing to operate freely.</p><p>‍</p><p> </p><p> </p><h4><strong>Companies brokering arms to Myanmar military </strong></h4><p>The following companies are confirmed to have brokered arms and equipment to the Myanmar military, and are divided into three categories, based on the current status of their identified business activities.</p><p>Category “A” lists brokers of arms and equipment to the Myanmar military, who have had business with the Myanmar military since the attempted coup. </p><p>Category “B” lists brokers of arms and equipment to the Myanmar military, who have conducted business with the Myanmar military following the Rohingya genocide from 2017 or later.  </p><p>Justice For Myanmar calls for companies, directors and shareholders listed in category “A” and “B” to be sanctioned for their involvement in supplying the Myanmar military. </p><p>Category “C” includes brokers of arms and equipment to the Myanmar military, who have conducted business with the Myanmar military from 2015-2016, or where dates are not confirmed. The companies, their shareholders and directors should be monitored as there is a risk that they may have continued business with the Myanmar military. Any ongoing business with the Myanmar military must result in sanctions. </p><p>The sources are based on documents from the Myanmar Ministry of Defence&#x27;s procurement department that have been leaked to JFM<em>, </em>previous disclosures made public by JFM,<em> </em>industry sources and other online and media sources. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Download the list of Myanmar military arms broker companies and individuals (22 October 2023): </strong><a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876/653609ce7a7f1db2e9d9b3f5_Myanmar%20arms%20broker%20companies%20%26%20individuals%20(22%20Oct%202023).xlsx"><strong>Download Excel File</strong></a><strong> (64 kb)</strong></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Updates</strong></p><p><strong>(20 January 2025)</strong>: Myint Thein @ Phan Chaung ceased being a director and shareholder of Amber Star.

the Myanmar military, with arms exports and technology transfers continuing, even after the Myanmar military has committed mass murder amounting to atrocity crimes following its illegitimate coup attempt. </p><p>According to Ukrainian export data, accessed via Import Genius, Motor Sich exported engines and parts to Myanmar twice since the military’s attempted coup.

The Mission also reached the conclusion under the general rules of State responsibility that prohibit aiding or assisting another State in the commission of an internationally wrongful act, that these States knew, or were virtually certain, that the assistance would be used for unlawful purposes.”</em></p><p>Ukraine has so far blatantly ignored the Fact-Finding Mission’s recommendations, proceeding with arms and technology transfers and the development of the manufacturing plant after the August 2019 report.  </p><p>Following the attempted coup, Ukraine’s shameful history of arms sales was on display in the streets as the military used older Ukrainian BTR-3Us as part of the bloody crackdown. </p><p>Despite overwhelming evidence of Ukraine’s complicity in the Myanmar military’s international crimes, the country is sticking to its bilateral military technical cooperation agreement and has not imposed an arms embargo. </p><p>Asked by <a href="https://www.dw.com/uk/prypynit-ozbroiuvaty-nashykh-vbyvts-shcho-robyty-z-ukrainskymy-btramy-dlia-mianmy/a-58924793">Deutsche Welle</a> if they will stop cooperation with the Myanmar military following the attempted coup, a spokesperson for Ukroboronprom, the association of state arms enterprises, responded that they export in accordance with Ukrainian law and international obligations, noting that Ukraine has not imposed sanctions or an arms embargo on Myanmar. </p><p>The spokesperson also said that the military technical cooperation agreement is still valid under the military junta. “Following socio-political stabilisation of the situation in Myanmar, we hope to continue to pursue our existing obligations”.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Stop the flow of arms!</h4><p>Since the illegal attempted coup, the military junta has murdered 1049 people, including children as young as six, with over 6200 still detained as of <a href="https://aappb.org/?p=17501">September 6</a>. An <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/un-humanitarian-agency-says-230000-displaced-myanmar-this-year-2021-06-24/">estimated 230,000</a> have been displaced as of June, many in ethnic areas, as the Myanmar military has dramatically increased <a href="https://acleddata.com/2021/07/22/myanmars-spring-revolution/">airstrikes and shelling</a>, which amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. These attacks likely involve Ukrainian technology. </p><p>Ukraine must end its complicity in the Myanmar military’s atrocity crimes. Immediate steps that need to be taken include imposing an arms embargo, cutting ties with the Myanmar military, revoking the bilateral military technical cooperation agreement, preventing production at the joint arms plant and withdrawing Aung Hlaing Oo’s position as honorary consul.  </p><p>Given Ukraine’s persistent failure to abide by international law and norms, the international community must also act to ensure Ukraine fulfils its international obligations. </p><p>Ukraine receives significant military aid from the US, UK and EU. The US alone has provided approximately <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/18/white-house-ukraine-military-lethal-weapons-495169">US$2.5 billion</a> in military aid to Ukraine since 2014, with US$60 million <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/u-s-commits-to-60-million-in-aid-to-ukraine-before-white-house-visit">announced</a> in August.  </p><p>Ukroboronprom holds <a href="https://nato.mfa.gov.ua/en/news/28924-ukroboronprom-pogliblyuje-spivrobitnictvo-z-nato">regular talks</a> with NATO and its member states, while NATO as recently as <a href="https://nako.org.ua/en/news/8581/">July 2021 </a>expressed a commitment to support the reform of Ukraine’s arms industry to bring it closer to “NATO standards”.</p><p>So why have Ukraine’s donors and allies tolerated the arms trade with Myanmar? We call on Ukraine’s partners to make future aid conditional on Ukraine imposing an arms embargo on Myanmar, shutting down the arms manufacturing plant and ending all military ties. </p><p>Without a global arms embargo on Myanmar, the criminal military junta will find ways to purchase arms to use against the people. It is imperative that the UN Security Council passes a resolution to stop the flow of arms to Myanmar.</p><p>Finally, the Myanmar military’s network of private arms companies, their directors and owners must be urgently targeted for sanctions and denied access to international banks. </p><p>The UK’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-dominic-raab-announces-new-myanmar-sanctions#:~:text=Enforced%20with%20immediate%20effect%2C%20sanctions,resources%20to%20both%20those%20designated.">decision</a> to impose sanctions on Tay Za and Htoo Group, and the US <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/07/commerce-increases-restrictions-burmese-military-adding-four-entities">restrictions</a> on King Royal Technologies, are positive steps but more businesses procuring arms and dual use goods for the Myanmar military must be sanctioned at a faster pace to make an impact on the military junta.</p><p>Singapore must end the use of its territory as a business hub for arms brokers.</p><p>As the Myanmar military’s terror campaign continues, the international community needs to step up and take concrete action against the criminal Myanmar military and its partners. The Myanmar military cartel must be dismantled.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Explore our evidence</h4><p>Interstellar Ltd aircraft proposal (<a href="https://jfm-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/Interstellar.Ltd.pdf">PDF</a>)</p><p>Myanmar Chemical &amp; Machinery profile (<a href="https://jfm-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/MCM+profile.pdf">PDF</a>)</p><p>Myanmar Chemical &amp; Machinery technical proposal (<a href="https://jfm-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/MCM+Proposal.pdf">PDF</a>)</p><p>Myanmar Consultancy Company C235 proposal (<a href="https://jfm-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/Myanmar+Consultancy+CN+235+Technical+Proposal.pdf">PDF</a>)</p><p>Sky Aviator Mi-24P upgrade proposal (<a href="https://jfm-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/Sky+Aviator+Mi-24+Upgrade.pdf">PDF</a>)</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Correction (September 8, 2021)</strong></p><p>Motor Sich&#x27;s May 2021 shipment was to the Myanmar army&#x27;s directorate of procurement, not the air force.</p><p><strong>Update (September 30, 2021)</strong></p><p>Text updated with comment from Sit Taing Aung of Yatanarpon Aviation Support, denying any relations with the Myanmar military.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="footer container w-container"><div class="mailing-list-signup"><div class="w-form"><h3 class="heading-for-section">This situation is evolving.

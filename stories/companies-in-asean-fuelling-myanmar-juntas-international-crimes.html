class="w-richtext"><p>More than four years after the Myanmar military’s attempted coup, companies across the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region continue to do business with the junta. They have provided the junta with a major source of revenue, as well as communications technology and aviation fuel. </p><p>These networks of corporate complicity have been essential to sustain the junta’s ongoing nationwide terror campaign, which involves indiscriminate air and artillery strikes, mass killings, the destructions of whole communities, mass arbitrary arrest, torture and the forced displacement of at least <a href="https://www.unocha.org/publications/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-update-no-46-23-may-2025">3.5 million people</a>. </p><p>Despite numerous companies cutting ties with the Myanmar military and the imposition of targeted sanctions, the companies featured here maintained business as usual with the junta. In some significant cases, these businesses are actually owned by ASEAN member states. </p><p>This goes against ASEAN’s claimed support for peace in Myanmar though its Five Point Consensus. ASEAN member states have not only failed to end the Myanmar military’s violence – they have allowed companies under their jurisdiction to fund and equip the military as its commits international crimes with total impunity. </p><p>Companies in the ASEAN region have helped the military generate revenue through its conglomerates, Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and Myanma Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL), and through revenue from land controlled by the Myanmar army’s Office of the Quartermaster General. Since the coup attempt in 2021, companies in ASEAN have also financed the junta through business with state-owned enterprises illegally under junta control, such as Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), Myanma Timber Enterprise (MTE) and junta-controlled ministries. </p><p>This investigation details cases of corporate complicity from across the ASEAN region, focusing on the provision of funds, communications technology and aviation fuel to the junta. However, it is not a complete list and there are many more companies in the region that have done dirty deals with the junta. This investigation does not include arms brokers, which were the focus of an <a href="./stories/exposed-companies-brokering-arms-equipment-to-myanmar-military">investigation we published in 2022</a> and detailed in reports by the UN Special Rapporteur on Myanmar in <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/countries/myanmar/crp-sr-myanmar-2023-05-17.pdf">2023</a> and <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session56/a-hrc-56-crp-7.pdf">2024</a>. </p><p>ASEAN governments have a duty to prevent companies in their jurisdiction from providing the junta with revenue, technology and aviation fuel, in line with their obligations under international law and norms. Yet, instead of taking steps to cut off the resources needed for the junta to continue its violence, ASEAN and its member states have largely turned a blind eye to business complicity, while providing false legitimacy to the junta and impeding effective international action.</p><p>Justice For Myanmar calls on companies in ASEAN to immediately cut the junta’s access to funds, arms, equipment, technology and aviation fuel. ASEAN governments must prevent continued corporate complicity. </p><p>ASEAN and its governments must support a Myanmar-led solution to solve the crisis.</p><figure style="max-width:1762pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ebc5bfff55a6d3b63cfff37/6831770105b847e698f8c1b4_D7.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""/></div></figure><h3>Oil and gas fuelling atrocities</h3><p>MOGE, the state-owned enterprise illegally seized by the junta through its 2021 coup attempt, is the junta’s single largest source of foreign revenue through fossil fuel sales.</p><p>MOGE has been <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/02/21/myanmar-burma-eu-imposes-restrictive-measures-on-22-individuals-and-4-entities-in-fourth-round-of-sanctions/">sanctioned by the EU</a>, while the US Treasury has issued a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1856">financial services directive</a> against it.  </p><p>Despite this, oil and gas companies from Thailand and Singapore have been fuelling atrocities in Myanmar by producing oil and gas with the junta, as well as supplying the junta with the oil it needs to continue committing international crimes.</p><p>The junta-controlled oil and gas sector has been sustained by <a href="./stories/the-international-oilfield-services-companies-supporting-the-myanmar-juntas-oil-and-gas-industry">oilfield service providers</a> from Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam that have continued operating in Myanmar since the military’s attempted coup, ensuring revenue keep flowing to the junta.<br/><br/>‍<strong>PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP) and PTT<br/>Thailand</strong></p><p>Thailand’s partially state-owned oil giant PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited (PTTEP), which is publicly listed, operates two major offshore gas projects—Yadana and Zawtika— along with associated pipelines in partnership with MOGE, funding junta atrocities. Despite ongoing international crimes committed by the military, PTTEP has continued producing and even expanding its operations by <a href="https://market.sec.or.th/public/idisc/Download?FILEID=dat/news/202410/0355NWS281020241730380251E.pdf">drilling wells</a>.</p><p>The Yadana gas project was formerly operated by France’s TotalEnergies until it withdrew in July 2022, at which point PTTEP took over as the operator. Chevron followed suit, divesting from the project in April 2024, and redistributing its interest to PTTEP and MOGE. These withdrawals increased PTTEP’s stake in the project to 63%. </p><p>Similarly, PTTEP operates the Zawtika gas project, where it holds an 80% controlling interest, with MOGE holding the remaining 20%.</p><p>The Yadana project has long been a lucrative source of revenue for the illegitimate junta through the sale of gas to PTT Public Company Limited, the parent company of PTTEP.</p><p>As the largest investor and operator of both the Yadana and Zawtika gas projects, Thailand’s PTTEP remains a key business partner of the illegal Myanmar junta. Through its involvement in these projects, PTTEP and PTT and its owner, the Thai government, are complicit in the junta’s war crimes and crimes against humanity. </p><p>Also see Justice For Myanmar February 2023 report: <a href="./stories/the-international-oilfield-services-companies-supporting-the-myanmar-juntas-oil-and-gas-industry">The international oilfield services companies supporting the Myanmar junta’s oil and gas industry</a>.<br/><br/>‍<strong>Northern Gulf Petroleum<br/>Thailand</strong></p><p>In 2022, the Myanmar military junta appointed <a href="./press-releases/petronas-pttep-eneos-mitsubishi-corp-japan-gov-irresponsibly-exiting-yetagun-gas-project">Gulf Petroleum Myanmar (GPM)</a> as operator of the Yetagun gas project following the exit of the Malaysian state-owned oil company Petronas. </p><p>GPM is a private oil and gas company that is part of Thailand’s Northern Gulf Petroleum group. Northern Gulf Petroleum has a complex structure, with shell companies in Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, and Singapore - which are known <a href="https://cthi.taxjustice.net/en">corporate tax havens</a>. </p><p>Northern Gulf Petroleum in Myanmar operates in partnership with the crony SMART Group of Companies, established under the former dictatorship to service the military controlled petroleum industry. The leadership of GPM includes Kyaw Kyaw Hlaing, chair and director of the SMART Group.</p><p>The Yetagun gas project was formerly operated by a consortium led by Petronas Carigali, along with Thailand’s PTTEP, Japan’s Nippon Oil Exploration (Myanmar), and MOGE. Nippon Oil Exploration (Myanmar) is jointly owned by JX Nippon Oil &amp; Gas Exploration (a subsidiary of ENEOS Holdings), the Government of Japan, and Mitsubishi Corporation.</p><p>The selection of GPM as a successor implies that Petronas and its partners have not taken adequate measures to identify, prevent, mitigate and remedy the negative environmental and social impacts related to their withdrawal. The irresponsible divestment of Petronas and their partners will provide the Myanmar military junta with a continuing source of revenue, and heightens environmental risks from the decommissioning of the gas field, which is near depletion.<br/>‍<strong><br/>Interra Resources<br/>Singapore </strong></p><p>Since the military’s illegal coup attempt, the Singapore-listed company Interra Resources has helped supply the junta with over three million barrels of oil, fuelling its ongoing war crimes and crimes against humanity. The oil is worth over US$200 million.</p><p>Singapore-based Interra Resources Ltd owns 60% of one of the few companies still extracting oil from Myanmar’s onshore fields, Goldpetrol Joint Operating Company Inc., which operates the Chauk and Yenangyaung oil projects. The other 40% of Goldpetrol is owned by North Petroleum International Co. Ltd. North Petroleum International is a subsidiary of China North Industries Group Corporation (NORINCO), a Chinese state-owned arms conglomerate.</p><p>Between January 2021 and the end of 2024, Interra Resources reported more than US$72 million in revenues from Myanmar, according to data from Interra Resources’ annual reports.</p><p>Oil extracted by Goldpetrol is transferred to Myanma Petrochemical Enterprise (MPE), which controls the downstream petroleum sector and has responsibility for the refining, storage and distribution of domestically extracted petrochemical products, including aviation fuel, which the junta needs for its ongoing aerial attacks against civilians.</p><p>Also see Justice For Myanmar January 2025 report: <a href="./stories/the-singapore-listed-company-fuelling-war-crimes-in-myanmar">The Singapore-listed company fuelling war crimes in Myanmar</a>.<strong><br/><br/>ENRA Group <br/>Malaysia</strong></p><p>ENRA Group Berhad is an oilfield services provider listed on the stock exchange of Malaysia.

The Special Rapporteur <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session56/a-hrc-56-crp-7.pdf">reported</a> that SCB played a crucial role in the shift, with transactions related to Myanmar military procurement increasing from over US$5 million in the 2022 financial year to over US$100 million in the 2023 financial year. </p><p>In a <a href="https://www.scb.co.th/en/about-us/news/jun-2024/scbmm-transaction">statement</a> published in June 2024, SCB responded that “these transactions are not connected to the arms trade as reported in the news, and total value has not significantly increased compared to last year.

Junta airstrikes have even continued following the devastating earthquake that struck Myanmar on March 28. According to a May 2 <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/05/1162881">statement</a> from the United Nations, the junta launched at least 171 airstrikes since the earthquake. Airstrikes are indiscriminate or even targeted at populated civilian areas, including <a href="https://myanmar-now.org/mm/news/63682/">one attack</a> on 12 May that killed 22 students and two teachers at a school in Sagaing. Justice For Myanmar calls for an immediate ban on the export of aviation fuel to Myanmar.<strong><br/><br/>Shoon Group companies<br/>Singapore</strong></p><p>Shoon Group (formerly Asia Sun Group) is a group of Myanmar crony companies involved in procuring, storing and distributing aviation fuel in partnership with the junta. It has subsidiaries in both Singapore and Myanmar that have been found to import aviation fuel and directly deliver it to the Myanmar military. </p><p>The group has three Singapore companies: </p><ul role="list"><li><strong>PEIA Pte. Ltd.</strong> is a beneficial shareholder of National Energy Prime Aviation Services Co. Ltd. (NEPAS), a joint venture with the junta controlled Myanma Petrochemical Enterprise, which is responsible for the import, storage and sale of aviation fuel in Myanmar. </li><li><strong>P.E.I Energy Pte. Ltd.</strong> (formerly Puma Energy Irrawaddy Pte. Ltd.) is the owner of Myan Oil Terminal Company Limited (formerly Puma Energy Asia Sun Company Limited), which operates a major fuel terminal and storage tanks in Yangon. </li><li><strong>Shoon Energy Pte.

Ltd. has also been sanctioned by the <a href="https://search-uk-sanctions-list.service.gov.uk/designations/MYA0066/Entity">UK</a>.

Hai Linh’s activities have continued despite the US Government’s issuance of a<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1701"> determination on the jet fuel sector</a> that “allows for sanctions to be imposed on any foreign individual or entity determined to operate in the jet fuel sector of the Burmese economy.”</p><p>‍</p><h1>Profiting from the Myanmar crisis </h1><p>As exposed here, companies across ASEAN, some which are state-owned, continued business or even expanded operations in Myanmar after the coup attempt, profiting as the military’s nationwide terror campaign against the people widened.</p><p>That is despite the Five Point Consensus, agreed upon by ASEAN leaders and junta chief Min Aung Hlaing in April 2021, which has proven to be a complete failure. The Consensus calls for an immediate cessation of violence. Yet, four years on, the Myanmar military has only intensified its brutal attacks on the people of Myanmar—enabled by revenue, aviation fuel and communications technology from companies operating in ASEAN member states.</p><p>Corporate complicity has allowed the junta to continue its relentless shelling and airstrikes, killing children and targeting schools, places of worship, displacement camps, and civilian infrastructure. Without its corporate enablers, the junta would be choked of funds, arms, technology and aviation fuel. Its campaign of terror would grind to a halt. </p><p>The junta has escalated its violence further through forced conscription, causing widespread displacement. Even in the wake of a devastating 7.7 magnitude earthquake, the military has persisted in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/100066442880707/photos/1039093401648746/">launching more than 700</a> air and artillery strikes, and obstructed aid and recovery efforts. </p><p>While ASEAN partners the US, Australia, EU, UK and Canada have sanctioned the junta, enterprises under its control, and its associates, ASEAN members and companies in their territory have largely maintained business as usual. </p><p>ASEAN must encourage member states to cut off the junta’s access to funds, arms, dual use goods, technology and aviation fuel, and immediately stop legitimising the junta. Member states must use their financial, policy, and legal levers to regulate their companies that still trade with the junta.</p><p>This must mean moving beyond the Five-Point Consensus to achieve a Myanmar people-led solution to resolve the crisis, as <a href="./press-releases/civil-society-position-paper-addressing-aseans-goal-of-a-myanmar-owned-and--led-solution">demanded</a> by civil society groups. Without changing course, Myanmar civilians will continue to die and the crisis will only worsen. It is time for ASEAN, its member states and businesses to end their complicity with the Myanmar junta. The lives of Myanmar people depend on it.</p></div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876/6667459be273630d36fac109_downloads.svg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-15 w-condition-invisible"/><div class="rich-text-block-2 w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div></div></div><div class="tags-label-wrapper"><div class="featured-stories-tags">TAGS</div></div><div class="collection-list-wrapper-3 w-dyn-list"><div role="list" class="collection-list-6 w-dyn-items"><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="../tags/asean.html">ASEAN</a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="../tags/thailand.html">Thailand</a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="../tags/malaysia.html">Malaysia</a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="../tags/singapore.html">Singapore</a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="../tags/indonesia.html">Indonesia</a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="../tags/vietnam.html">Vietnam</a></div></div></div></div><div class="footer container w-container"><div class="mailing-list-signup"><div class="w-form"><div class="heading-for-section"><div class="highlighter---static">This situation is evolving.</div></div><form id="email-form" name="email-form" data-name="Email Form" action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/justiceformyanmar" method="post" class="form w-clearfix" data-wf-page-id="5fdd49333a651b707dc659f7" data-wf-element-id="33e070a5-3b15-09fe-7668-a4750d487ac3"><input class="text-field w-input" maxlength="256" name="email" data-name="email" placeholder="your@email.com" type="email" id="email-3" required=""/><input class="text-field-half-width w-input" maxlength="256" name="organization" data-name="organization" placeholder="Organisation (optional)" type="text" id="organization"/><input class="text-field-half-width w-input" maxlength="256" name="name" data-name="name" placeholder="Name (optional)" type="text" id="name-3"/><input type="submit" data-wait="Please wait..." class="submit-button w-button" value="Sign Up"/><div class="div-block"><div class="w-form-formrecaptcha recaptcha g-recaptcha g-recaptcha-error g-recaptcha-disabled g-recaptcha-invalid-key"></div></div></form><div class="success-message w-form-done"><div>Thank you!

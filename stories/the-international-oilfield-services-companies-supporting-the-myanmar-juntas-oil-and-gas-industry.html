companies supporting the Myanmar junta’s oil and gas industry</p></div></div><div class="container w-container"><div class="two-thirds-width"><div class="text-block">February 1, 2023</div><div class="w-richtext"><p>Myanmar’s oil and gas industry provides enormous revenues to the illegal military junta, enabling it to wage a brutal offensive against its own people.</p><p>Now newly-leaked documents and corporate records reveal that some of the world’s biggest oilfield services companies, including Baker Hughes, Halliburton and Schlumberger, have continued to work in Myanmar after the military’s attempted coup, helping the flow of gas – and revenues vital to the junta – to continue.</p><p>Justice For Myanmar has identified 22 companies from the United States and other countries that help to prop up the military junta.</p><p>We believe oilfield services companies have made themselves complicit with the junta as it commits war crimes and crimes against humanity against the people of Myanmar.</p><p> </p><h4><strong>Why the gas industry matters for the junta</strong></h4><p>On February 1, 2021, the Myanmar military staged an illegal attempted coup. The junta responded to mass and sustained nationwide resistance to the coup attempt with a campaign of terror. </p><p>The junta has since murdered more than 2,900 people and arbitrarily arrested over 17,000 according to the <a href="https://aappb.org/">Assistance Association for Political Prisoners</a>, and is conducting indiscriminate air strikes and shelling across the country, killing at random, destroying property and displacing over 1.1 million people. </p><p>The oil and gas industry is <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-s-sanctions-hit-junta-still-netting-vast-oil-gas-profits/6697189.html">the biggest source</a> of foreign-currency revenue for the junta. Oil and gas revenue is used to purchase arms, jet fuel and other supplies needed for the junta&#x27;s continuing commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.gnlm.com.mm/natural-gas-export-bags-over-us800-million-from-april-to-july/">junta’s own figures</a>, Myanmar earned US$1.72 billion from gas exports in the six months to March 31, 2022 alone. </p><p>Some international energy giants have withdrawn from Myanmar or announced their exit following the military’s coup attempt. They include TotalEnergies, Chevron, Petronas, Eneos, Mitsubishi and Woodside Petroleum.</p><p>But gas revenue is clearly still flowing as operators continue business as usual in the junta’s oil and gas sector, against their international human rights responsibilities. </p><p>Worldwide calls for companies to stop bankrolling the Myanmar military have gained momentum with hundreds of thousands of people signing a <a href="https://actions.sumofus.org/a/stop-funding-myanmar-military">petition</a> and <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/president-biden-stop-oil-companies-from-bankrolling-the-myanmar-military">letter</a> calling on oil gas companies to stop supporting the bloodbath in Myanmar. </p><p> </p><h4><strong>The organisation which controls Myanmar’s lucrative oil and gas</strong></h4><p>The junta maintains a grip on the sector through the Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), a government agency which it illegally controls. </p><p>MOGE regulates the sector and acts as both a state revenue collector and commercial partner in oil and gas projects, ensuring the junta gets lucrative tax and royalty payments, as well as a vast share of profits. </p><p>Most of the junta’s oil and gas revenues come from a series of <a href="how-oil-and-gas-majors-bankroll-the-myanmar-military-regime.html">offshore gas fields</a>, with the majority coming from its role as state revenue collector and a small proportion coming from its commercial stake in each project:  </p><ul role="list"><li>The Shwe gas project is operated by the South Korean corporation, POSCO International. MOGE has a 15% stake in the <a href="https://www.offshore-technology.com/marketdata/shwe-complex-conventional-gas-field-myanmar/">project</a>.</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>The Yadana gas project was formerly operated by France’s TotalEnergies until it pulled <a href="https://totalenergies.com/media/news/press-releases/totalenergies-has-definitively-withdrawn-myanmar">out</a> in July 2022, and <a href="https://www.offshore-technology.com/news/thailands-pttep-confirms-takeover-of-myanmar-gas-field/">is now operated by Thailand’s PTTEP</a>. The US oil company Chevron holds the biggest stake in the project at 41.1%, which it is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/01/myanmar-oil-gas-companies-profits-regime-coup">selling</a> to the Canadian company, <a href="../press-releases/justice-for-myanmar-calls-for-canadian-and-uk-sanctions-on-moge-following-mti-energys-investment-in-the-yadana-gas-project.html">MTI Energy</a>. MOGE <a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2279079/pttep-to-operate-myanmar-gas-field-after-totalenergies-exit">has a 21.8% stake</a> in Yadana, which increased from 15% as a result of TotalEnergies&#x27; withdrawal. <em> </em></li></ul><ul role="list"><li>The Zawtika gas project is also operated by PTTEP. MOGE has a 20% stake in the project.<sup> </sup> </li></ul><ul role="list"><li>The Yetagun gas project, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/malaysias-petronas-withdraws-myanmars-yetagun-field-2022-04-29/">formerly operated by Malaysia’s Petronas</a>, has been taken over by the Thai company, <a href="../press-releases/petronas-pttep-eneos-mitsubishi-corp-japan-gov-irresponsibly-exiting-yetagun-gas-project.html">Gulf Petroleum Myanmar</a>. MOGE has a 20.5% stake in the project. </li></ul><p> </p><h4><strong>Companies, governments and investors must act</strong> </h4><p>International oilfield services companies in Myanmar’s oil and gas industry have worked directly and indirectly with MOGE. This has included working since the coup attempt on POSCO International’s plans to develop the Shwe gas project and PTTEP’s plans to develop the Zawtika gas project.</p><p>These oilfield services companies provide critical support and equipment to the sector, from drilling to maintenance to supply. By doing so, they help to keep the gas revenues flowing to the junta, making them complicit in its international crimes.</p><p>By propping up this industry, major corporations are breaching their international responsibilities under the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf">UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights</a> and the <a href="http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/guidelines/">OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises</a> to identify, mitigate and remedy negative human rights, and to responsibly disengage if they cannot end their links to severe human rights violations. By failing to act, companies risk deepening complicity in the junta’s atrocity crimes, which are backed by oil and gas payments.</p><p> </p><p>Companies also face sanctions risks. The <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0180">United States</a>, <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/11/08/myanmar-burma-eu-imposes-further-restrictive-measures-on-19-individuals-and-one-entity/">European Union</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-announces-further-sanctions-on-companies-linked-to-myanmars-military-regime">United Kingdom</a> have put sanctions on the ruling body of the junta, the State Administration Council, which illegally controls MOGE through the junta’s Ministry of Energy. In February 2022, the European Union became the first jurisdiction to <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/02/21/myanmar-burma-eu-imposes-restrictive-measures-on-22-individuals-and-4-entities-in-fourth-round-of-sanctions/">sanction MOGE</a> itself. EU sanctions prohibit the provision of economic resources that directly or indirectly benefit MOGE (with a narrow exemption for technical assistance related to the decommissioning of projects), applicable to the activities of oilfield services companies. While the <a href="https://www.state.gov/marking-two-years-since-the-military-coup-in-burma/">US</a> sanctioned the junta’s energy minister and MOGE managing director and deputy managing director to mark the second anniversary of the military’s illegal coup attempt, it stopped short of designating MOGE the entity.</p><p>We call on all oilfield services companies that are not within the remit of EU sanctions to stop their activities in Myanmar unless the projects they are working on suspend payments to the junta, and withhold them in protected accounts. As part of a campaign of <a href="https://earthrights.org/publication/myanmar-fact-sheet/">disinformation</a> seemingly aimed at ensuring business as usual, TotalEnergies, POSCO International and Chevron have all suggested at various times that they have no power to divert revenues, but there are <a href="https://earthrights.org/publication/briefer-how-totalenergies-and-chevron-can-divest-responsibly-from-myanmar/">practical steps</a> gas companies have refused to take to do so.  </p><p>International investors, including pension funds and their asset managers holding shares in the below mentioned oilfield services companies, also have a responsibility under the UN Guiding Principles and the OECD Guidelines to use their leverage to convince their investee companies to act responsibly, and to divest from those companies if they do not act responsibly. If the asset managers do not do so, the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/investment/due-diligence-guidance-for-responsible-business-conduct.htm">OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct</a> indicates that they risk deepening their relationship to and responsibility for the atrocity crimes the Myanmar junta is committing with oil and gas revenue. In 2021, a significant TotalEnergies’ shareholder <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211220005871/en/Coast-Capital-Demands-TotalEnergies-Pull-Out-of-Myanmar-Oil-and-Gas-Enterprise">stated</a> that “it is clear that TotalEnergies is indirectly helping finance crimes against humanity in Myanmar” and Norway’s Oil Fund has <a href="https://www.nbim.no/en/the-fund/news-list/2022/decisions-on-observation-and-exclusion4/">divested from PTT</a> over its business with the Myanmar junta. More investors need to urgently act.</p><p>The United States in particular should stop sending mixed messages to US companies about investing in Myanmar’s oil and gas industry. The US Commerce Department’s <a href="https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/burma-oil-and-gas">Country Commercial Guide</a> for Myanmar, last updated in July 2022, describes the sector as a “best prospect industry” with “significant opportunities for U.S investors in the Burmese energy market”. It lists opportunities in areas including exploration and feasibility studies, onshore and offshore extraction, processing and support for machinery and maintenance. The guide recommends companies directly compete in junta tenders: “Tender notices from government ministries are published on the regime’s Ministry of Energy website.”</p><p>This comes despite a US State Department <a href="https://www.state.gov/risks-and-considerations-for-businesses-and-individuals-with-exposure-to-entities-responsible-for-undermining-democratic-processes-facilitating-corruption-and-committing-human-rights-abuses-in-burma/">Business Advisory</a> from January 2022 warning that state-owned enterprises are key providers of economic resources for the junta, and that companies and individuals exposed to state-owned enterprises face “significant reputational, financial, and legal risks, including violations of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and sanctions, as well as abetting human rights abuses.” At the top of the list is MOGE.</p><p>With the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7776/text?r=3&amp;s=1">National Defense Authorization Act</a> signed into law in December, the US must act now and impose sanction on MOGE, in coordination with its allies the UK, Canada and Australia.  </p><p>Governments must also prevent companies in their territory from supporting Myanmar’s oil and gas sector because of its role in propping up the junta, in accordance with their state obligations under the UN Guiding Principles. </p><p> </p><h4><strong>Oilfield services companies with business in Myanmar since the attempted coup</strong></h4><p>An investigation by Justice For Myanmar has identified 22 oilfield services companies from the United States and other countries that have helped to maintain and expand the oil and gas industry of Myanmar, despite knowing that since February 2021, revenues from this industry are the main financial prop for a brutal and illegal junta. </p><p>According to tax filings received by Distributed Denial of Secrets, Justice For Myanmar sources, company disclosures and other sources, oilfield services companies continued to do business in Myanmar, and profit, since the military’s illegal attempted coup.  </p><p>In alphabetical order, these include:</p><p> </p><h4><strong>Baker Hughes (USA) </strong></h4><p>Baker Hughes is a global oilfield services company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with a branch office in Myanmar. It is part of a consortium of companies which won a 2018 <a href="https://investors.bakerhughes.com/news-releases/news-release-details/posco-daewoo-corp-selects-mcdermott-and-bhge-surf-and-subsea">contract</a> from POSCO International for work related to Shwe Phase Two, an expansion of the Shwe gas project.</p><p>Baker Hughes has also provided services to PTTEP as recently as March 2022, according to leaked filings. </p><p>A tax record shows that in the six months to March 31, 2022, Baker Hughes made US$2.66 million in profits before tax on service revenue of US$10.96 million. </p><p>This tax record mentions POSCO as a customer, though some of these revenues do not appear to have been earned from the oil and gas industry.</p><p>Baker Hughes shareholders include Capital Group, Vanguard, State Street Global Advisors, BlackRock, JPMorgan and Norges Bank Investment Management.</p><p> </p><h4><strong>Ben Line Agencies (Singapore/Jersey)</strong></h4><p>Ben Line Agencies is a privately-owned international shipping and logistics corporation that has provided support vessels for the Shwe gas project following the military’s coup attempt, according to a source with knowledge of the industry.  </p><p>It has a <a href="https://www.benlineagencies.com/contact_category/myanmar/">subsidiary in Myanmar</a> with directors from Australia and Malta, and operates a branch office in Kyaukphyu, western Myanmar, near the Shwe Gas field. <strong> </strong></p><h4><strong>China Oilfield Services Limited (China)</strong></h4><p>China Oilfield Services Limited (COSL) is a subsidiary of the state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation. COSL is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and has a branch office in Myanmar. </p><p>Since the coup attempt, the company has supplied a semi-submersible rig to Myanmar which has been received by MOGE on behalf of PTTEP. This rig, the Shen Lan Tan Suo, is <a href="https://horizonship.com/pdf/World%20Rig%20Forcast%20May%202022.pdf">reported to have been contracted by PTTEP</a> to drill at the Zawtika project for 15 months from October 2022. </p><p>As of January 20, 2023, the Shen Lan Tan Suo was at the Yetagun gas field, according to vessel tracking data seen by Justice For Myanmar.</p><p>Other shareholders of COSL include Allianz SE.</p><h4><strong>Coens (South Korea)</strong></h4><p>Coens is a privately-owned South Korean oilfield services company with a subsidiary in Myanmar. Its services include recruitment and its <a href="https://www.coens.com/home/sub05_04.php">website</a> boasts “a comprehensive understanding of MOGE”.

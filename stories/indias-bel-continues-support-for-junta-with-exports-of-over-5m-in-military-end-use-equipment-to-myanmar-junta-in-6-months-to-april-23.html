w-container"><div class="two-thirds-width"><h2>June 21, 2023</h2><div class="w-richtext"><p>Indian arms manufacturing company Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) has continued selling military end-use material and technology to the illegal Myanmar military junta, according to Indian export records analysed by Justice For Myanmar. </p><p>Over a period of six months from November 2022 to April 2023, BEL transferred numerous military-end use products to Myanmar for a total value of US$5.1 million. These transfers have been done either directly to the Myanmar military, or the Myanmar companies Alliance Engineering Consultancy and Mega Hill General Trading, which are known arms brokers. </p><p>The shipments consisted of military end-use goods, technology, and technical documents to be used by the Myanmar military. </p><p>Items included metallic sonar domes; transducers and gaskets for the domes to be used on frigates, warships or submarines; directing gear systems; technical documents; sliprings and external fasteners; various items for item radio transmission or radar equipment, including base plates and power supplies; and manpack radios for communication while in the battlefield. </p><p>They are part of a pattern of Indian support for the Myanmar military and its domestic arms industry. Justice For Myanmar calls on India’s Quad partners and other allies to use their leverage to pressure India to stop the supply of arms and dual use goods and technology to the Myanmar military junta, including during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visits to the USA and France this year.  </p><p>India and the Myanmar military have long-standing defence cooperation. In his <a href="https://infosheet.org/node/3902">speech on 25 December 2022</a>, junta head and war criminal Min Aung Hlaing highlighted a need for large warships with high combat capabilities and the training of navy officers to operate the large warships, noting that naval officers had been sent to other countries, including Russia, China and India, to enhance their individual capabilities. India has trained Myanmar military personnel and undertaken joint naval exercises.</p><p>BEL has been supplying the Myanmar military with full knowledge that they can aid and abet its ongoing war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Myanmar Navy took part in the campaign of genocide against the Rohingya, and regularly intercepts Rohingya vessels for the junta and arbitrary arrests those on board. </p><p>BEL is controlled by the Indian government, which is the company’s majority shareholder, and its business with the Myanmar military amounts to a flagrant disregard for India’s obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law and its commitments under the Wassenaar arrangement.</p><p>BEL’s recent shipments to Myanmar follow numerous prior transfers of weapon systems to the Myanmar junta. In July 2021, BEL exported a remote-controlled weapon station (RCWS) to Myanmar, exposed in an earlier Justice For Myanmar <a href="https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/stories/bharat-electronics-ltd-arms-sales-continue-via-myanmar-military-broker-mega-hill-general-trading">report</a>. A <a href="https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/stories/bharat-electronics-limited-supplying-military-technology-to-myanmar-since-attempted-coup">June 2021 investigation</a> by Justice For Myanmar showed that BEL had exported a coastal surveillance system to Myanmar immediately before and following the military&#x27;s illegal February 1, 2021 attempted coup. BEL has also provided RAWL-Mk II radar equipment for the Myanmar Navy. On its official website, BEL <a href="https://bel-india.in/Manufacturing.aspx?&amp;q=search&amp;MId=16&amp;CId=1525&amp;LId=1&amp;link=1525&amp;modalid=modalproduct_1525">lists</a> the 2014 inauguration by the Myanmar Navy of a ship with BEL&#x27;s Sonar and Radar systems as a major export achievement for the company, publicly announcing also that the order was <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/business/stock/bharat-electronics-ltd_bel/reports-chairman-speech">high-value totalling USD 70.6 million</a>.

The fact that the Directorate of Procurement in Myanmar is listed as the recipient on trade-related documents eliminates any doubt of who the end-recipient would be. </p><p>On April 21, 2023, shipment records confirm that BEL transferred the following items for a total value of US$55,000 to the Myanmar military: </p><ul role="list"><li>Hoses of<strong> </strong>silicone rubber. The military typically requires specialist silicone hoses designed and built to high specifications and often requiring special shaped hoses, diameters, lengths and materials. </li><li>Slip rings and slip ring holders that allow for the transmission of power and electrical signals from a stationary to a rotating structure. A slip ring can be used in any electromechanical system that requires rotation while transmitting power or signals. In the military, sliprings can be used for shipborne radar turntables, rotating turrets on military armoured vehicles, airborne radar turntables or guidance systems such as the remote-controlled weapon station that BEL <a href="https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/stories/bharat-electronics-ltd-arms-sales-continue-via-myanmar-military-broker-mega-hill-general-trading">transferred</a> to the junta in June 2021, and the RAWL-Mk II radar equipment that BEL has supplied to the Myanmar Navy. </li><li>Sets of external fasteners that mechanically affix or join objects together. Military grade fasteners play a vital role across the army, navy, and air force.</li><li>Mounting base plates (true north) with the harmonised system (HS) code 8529.90, confirming that the item is a part for use with radio transmission or radar equipment. </li></ul><p>On December 31, 2022, BEL shipped a metallic dummy dome (BMS-X) for a total value of US$52,000 to the Myanmar army’s Directorate of Procurement. The listed HS code for the item – 9014.80.90 – indicates that it is a direction finding compass or navigational instrument or appliance. <a href="https://www.bel-india.in/writereaddata/BEL%20Export%20Booklet-11-05-23.pdf">An export brochure published by BEL</a> in May 2023 indicates that sonar domes can be integrated with the Hull Mounted Sonar X2 sonar system designed for frigates and warships. Specifically, the configuration has a modular system architecture so that variants of the system for each class of naval ship can be configured from the same basic building blocks. The system is supplied with associated auxiliary equipment, including a nearfield acoustic characterisation system for calibration of transducers, sonar domes, and directing gears for the transducer array.</p><p>In 2015, BEL <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151219235241/http:/www.financialexpress.com/article/economy/indian-sonars-to-power-foreign-navies/75649/">transferred</a> Hull Mounted Sonar systems (HMS-X) to Myanmar for use on the Aung Zeya class frigate, the first guided missile frigate built domestically by the Myanmar military. </p><p> </p><figure style="max-width:600pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ebc5bfff55a6d3b63cfff37/6492ecff16f0ef54e69ba53c_Sonar.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""/></div><figcaption><em>Photo of Myanmar Navy personnel at India&#x27;s Naval Physical and Oceanographic Laboratory, inspecting submarine systems.

The shipment included p<em>ower supply</em>modules and regulated power supplies, potentially for shipboard power supply, and three sonar dome gaskets. Sonar domes, located on the hulls of warships, protect critical electronic equipment used for detection and navigation. The domes permit acoustic energy to pass through with minimal sound transmission interference. </p><p>Records from Myanmar’s Directorate of Investment and Company Administration (DICA) confirm Kyaw Aung as the director of Alliance Engineering Services, and Win Min Hein as its sole shareholder. The company was founded by Linn Lett Thiri, wife of Ivan Htet, who is the son of the junta’s former air force chief Maung Maung Kyaw.

The military has committed rape and sexual violence against women, and indiscriminately bombed and shelled communities, causing deaths, property destruction and mass displacement. The Indian government, BEL, Alliance Engineering Services, Mega Hill General Trading and other businesses that supply the Myanmar military are complicit in these atrocities through the continued supply of arms, equipment and technology.</p><p>The recent BEL exports to Myanmar are part of a pattern of Indian complicity in the Myanmar military’s international crimes. India steadily increased defence co-operation with the Myanmar military after its campaign of genocide against the Rohingya in 2017. In July 2019, India and Myanmar signed a <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1580637">Memorandum of Understanding</a> to increase defence co-operation. According to <a href="https://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/values.php">data</a> from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), India was the third largest supplier of weapons to Myanmar for the years 2017-2022, behind Russia and China. In June 2021, India abstained from voting on a <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2021/ga12339.doc.htm">UN General Assembly</a> resolution calling on “all member states to prevent the flow of arms to Myanmar”, noting that the views of member states were not reflected in the resolution text. In December 2022, India, together with China and Russia, abstained in a <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/india-china-russia-abstain-on-unsc-resolution-on-myanmar/article66291314.ece">vote at the UN Security Council on a resolution</a> that demanded an immediate end to violence in Myanmar. </p><p>India is a member of the Wassenaar Arrangement, an export control regime that promotes transparency of national export control regimes on conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies. Under this arrangement, India is expected to apply export controls on transfers of arms and dual-use goods and technologies. India also has obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law to not transfer weapons when there is an expectation that these weapons could be used in violation of the Geneva Conventions, or to aid and abet atrocity crimes. The fact that BEL is an Indian state-owned company, coupled with the fact that Indian arms manufacturing companies have continued to supply weapons after the attempted coup in Myanmar, shows a serious disregard by the Indian government for its obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law, and its commitments under the Wassenaar Arrangement.</p><p>BEL is 51.14% owned by the Indian government and is publicly listed. Other shareholders include Nippon Life India Asset Management, Goldman Sachs, Vanguard, BlackRock, Fidelity, the Canadian Pension Plan, California Public Employees&#x27; Retirement System, California State Teachers Retirement System and Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec and the Swedish pension funds, AP-fonden (AP1), Andra AP-fonden (AP2) and Sjunde AP-fonden (AP7).  </p><p>The OECD Guidelines for multinational enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights compel institutional investors to use their leverage to ensure their investee companies act to prevent or mitigate human rights abuses. Investors are expected to divest from companies like BEL that have repeatedly failed to uphold their human rights responsibilities. </p><p>In July 2021, Nordea Bank placed BEL on its <a href="https://www.nordea.com/en/doc/nordea-exclusion-list0.pdf-0">exclusion list</a> for exporting arms to Myanmar. In February 2023, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund <a href="https://etikkradet.no/bharat-electronics-ltd-2/">excluded BEL</a> for selling arms to the Myanmar military, citing that such actions constitute &quot;serious and systematic violations of international humanitarian law”. More investors must now follow.</p><p>Justice For Myanmar calls for India to immediately impose an arms embargo on the Myanmar miliary and end its support for the junta. India’s allies should use their leverage to end India’s support for the Myanmar junta. </p></div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876/6667459be273630d36fac109_downloads.svg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-15 w-condition-invisible"/><div class="rich-text-block-2 w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div></div></div><div class="div-block-16"><div class="featured-stories-tags w-condition-invisible">TAGS</div></div><div class="collection-list-wrapper-3 w-dyn-list"><div class="empty-state-7 w-dyn-empty"></div></div></div><div class="footer container w-container"><div class="mailing-list-signup"><div class="w-form"><div class="heading-for-section"><div class="highlighter---static">This situation is evolving.</div></div><form id="email-form" name="email-form" data-name="Email Form" action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/justiceformyanmar" method="post" class="form w-clearfix" data-wf-page-id="5fdd49333a651b707dc659f7" data-wf-element-id="33e070a5-3b15-09fe-7668-a4750d487ac3"><input class="text-field w-input" maxlength="256" name="email" data-name="email" placeholder="your@email.com" type="email" id="email-3" required=""/><input class="text-field-half-width w-input" maxlength="256" name="organization" data-name="organization" placeholder="Organisation (optional)" type="text" id="organization"/><input class="text-field-half-width w-input" maxlength="256" name="name" data-name="name" placeholder="Name (optional)" type="text" id="name-3"/><input type="submit" data-wait="Please wait..." class="submit-button w-button" value="Sign Up"/><div class="div-block"><div class="w-form-formrecaptcha recaptcha g-recaptcha g-recaptcha-error g-recaptcha-disabled g-recaptcha-invalid-key"></div></div></form><div class="success-message w-form-done"><div>Thank you!

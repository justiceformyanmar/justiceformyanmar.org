class="two-thirds-width"><h2>March 27, 2024</h2><div class="w-richtext"><p>The Indian air force and public sector undertakings (PSUs) are continuing to provide military equipment, infrastructure and training to the illegal Myanmar junta, aiding and abetting its ongoing war crimes and crimes against humanity. </p><p>PSUs are state-owned enterprises that are majority owned by the Indian government. PSUs operate in sectors throughout the Indian economy including defence, in which there are <a href="https://www.ddpmod.gov.in/defence-public-sector-undertakings">16 PSUs</a> administered by India’s Ministry of Defence.  </p><p>India is the third biggest supplier of arms and equipment to Myanmar after Russia and China, supporting a campaign of terror the junta is waging across the country as the people overwhelmingly reject the military’s illegal February 2021 coup attempt. </p><p>An analysis of Indian trade data, corporate disclosures, parliamentary reports and other open-source information casts new light on the Myanmar military’s business with India and exposes the significant role of PSUs and the Indian Air Force. </p><p>Justice For Myanmar calls on India to immediately ban the transfer of all arms and associated equipment, technology and fuel to the Myanmar military and to cease all military training.  </p><p>Governments and companies that have business relationships with the Indian military and defence industry should use their leverage to urge a ban on all support for the Myanmar junta. </p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Indian support for the junta’s air force</strong></h2><p>Since the military’s illegal coup attempt, the junta has increasingly relied on its air force to wage  its campaign of terror against the people of Myanmar as it <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/tide-is-turning-against-myanmar-junta-un-special-rapporteur-says/7535619.html">loses control of territory</a> to ethnic resistance organisations and people’s defence forces.</p><p>The junta’s use of airstrikes are growing more frequent. An independent assessment of the junta’s use of airstrikes found that in just the last four months of 2023, the military <a href="https://nltstorage.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/pdf/Aerial+Attacks+...+Council+%283%29.pdf">carried out more than 750 airstrikes, with an average of six airstrikes taking place every day</a>. Airstrikes are indiscriminate, killing civilians including children and destroying whole communities. </p><p>For instance, on March 18, 2024, junta airstrikes in Minbya Township in Arakan State killed <a href="https://myanmar-now.org/en/news/death-will-follow-us-wherever-we-go-rohingya-civilians-lament-after-junta-targets-village-in-major-airstrike/">22 Rohingya</a>. More recently, airstrikes <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KPSN.karen/posts/pfbid035uGoWW1A8tKuN8NFNhadnMDTL3Ha1Xi6z95mZYCPZdBo9jaYRMnrPwAneW9tPrrKl">destroyed</a> schools, religious buildings and houses in Karen State. In February 2024, junta airstrikes destroyed a hospital and most of the homes in Ramree town, Arakan State. On January 7, 2024, the junta attacked a village in Sagaing Region, near the border of India, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/02/myanmar-military-air-strikes-that-killed-17-civilians-must-be-investigated-as-war-crimes/">killing 17 civilians</a> including at least nine children.</p><h4><strong>Indian Air Force</strong></h4><p>On January 2, 2024, the Indian Air Force’s 31 Movement Control Unit (MCU) shipped 52 items, all labelled as “defense goods”, to the Myanmar Air Force’s maintenance department at the Mingaladon air force base in Yangon. The shipment was addressed to Major Thant Zin Aung, the commanding officer of the base’s maintenance depot. </p><p>The 31 MCU is part of the Indian Air Force’s Maintenance Command and is based at the Palam Air Force Station in New Delhi. Movement Control Units play a key logistics and supply chain role in the Indian Air Force, handling the import and export of cargo on behalf of the air force. </p><p>Among other things, the shipped goods include sensors, thermometers, measuring and navigation tools and training materials. An analysis of the shipped goods suggests that they are intended for one or several automatic weather stations (AWS). An AWS is an automated version of the traditional weather station, used to save human labour and to enable measurements from remote and inaccessible areas. In December 2023, 15 staff of the Indian Air Force were deployed to Myanmar for the <a href="https://www.moes.gov.in/sites/default/files/MoES_Dec%2023%20English.pdf">installation of meteorological instruments</a>, likely in connection with the air force’s shipment to Myanmar in early 2024. </p><p>While AWS have broad applicability in the civilian sector, the fact that the items are labelled as “defense goods” and that both the shipper and consignee are military leaves no doubt as to the end-use of the equipment. </p><p>Military weather stations support the operation of military aircraft and combat systems by supplying critical information such as temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind speed, pressure and rainfall. This enhances the military’s knowledge of the current and forecast environment, which can increase the “effectiveness” of military operations and the accuracy of airstrikes. Among other uses, data obtained through AWS can be decisive for the timing of airstrikes, the aircraft used and the choice of weapons. </p><p>The 2024 shipment follows a prior shipment of 72 items of a similar nature by 31 MCU to the Office of the Commander in Chief of the Myanmar military on July 22, 2019. </p><p>India has supplied this equipment and provided direct technical support that will enhance the Myanmar military’s tactical abilities and precision with full knowledge of the Myanmar Air Force’s use of airstrikes against civilian targets across Myanmar. </p><h4><strong>Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL)</strong></h4><p><strong>‍</strong>Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is a PSU under India’s Ministry of Defence. Headquartered in Bangalore,<strong> </strong>HAL is involved in designing and manufacturing fighter jets, helicopters, jet engines and avionics. </p><p>HAL lists Myanmar as an active client, noting that its Aircraft Overhaul Division is <a href="https://hal-india.co.in/production-unit-details/aircraft-overhaul-division-nasik">“currently involved”</a> in the export of MiG spare parts to Myanmar, Vietnam, Malaysia, Peru, and Romania. Justice For Myanmar was unable to confirm the date HAL last supplied MiG parts and HAL did not respond to questions. The Myanmar Air Force has as <a href="https://www.myanmarwitness.org/aircraft/mig-29">many as 37 MiG-29</a>fighter jets which it uses to carry out <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-myanmar-government-83610d514aed6ff3ded0fee6f194b866">indiscriminate airstrikes</a>.</p><figure style="max-width:2552pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ebc5bfff55a6d3b63cfff37/66039ed18fab14876c60c950_HAL.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></div><figcaption>Source: HAL <a href="https://hal-india.co.in/production-unit-details/aircraft-overhaul-division-nasik">website</a></figcaption></figure><p>In August 2019, the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/FFM-Myanmar/EconomicInterestsMyanmarMilitary/A_HRC_42_CRP_3.pdf">UN Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar</a> identified HAL as having transferred several second-hand HAL HJT-16 Kiran trainer aircraft to the Myanmar military in 2018, citing the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In March 2021, a company spokesperson <a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/hindustan-aeronautics-denies-business-links-with-myanmar-s-military-11617204526811.html">stated</a>, “HAL has had no business dealings with Myanmar Defence Forces from 2017-2019. In fact, HAL did not have any business dealing even after 2019 with Myanmar till date.”</p><p>HAL also operates a joint venture – <a href="https://iralindia.com/">Indo-Russian Aviation Limited (IRAL)</a> – originally established in 1994 to provide product support and spare parts for Russian/Soviet Union-origin aircraft including MiG military aircraft. IRAL is based in Nasik, the same location as HAL’s Aircraft Overhaul Division.</p><p>IRAL’s shareholders include ICICI Bank Limited, JSC RAC MiG, GRPZ Ryazan &amp; Aviazapchast PLC. Justice For Myanmar has <a href="https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/stories/russian-arms-companies-requiring-sanctions-for-supplying-the-myanmar-military">previously exposed</a> MiG and Aviazpchast for having supplied aircraft parts to the Myanmar military after February 2021. MiG is part of Rostec, Russia’s biggest defence conglomerate that operates a representative office in Myanmar. Rostec has been sanctioned by India’s Western allies.</p><p>In March 2023, the US Department of Commerce added Aviazpchast to its <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulations-docs/federal-register-notices/federal-register-2023/3258-88-fr-18983-entity-list-rule-on-public-display-and-effective-3-28-23-published-3-30-23/file">Export Administration Regulations Entity List</a> for supplying the Myanmar military junta with equipment that enables its airstrikes. Aviazpchast posted a <a href="https://aviazapchast.com/department-of-commerce-notice-2023/">response</a> on its website claiming that it only supplies dual use goods and that its last supply of equipment to Myanmar was in September 2021. <a href="http://aviazapchast.com/about/partners/international-partners/">Aviazapchast continues to list Myanmar as one</a> of its eight closest partners.</p><figure style="max-width:3771pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ebc5bfff55a6d3b63cfff37/66039e0ff40263d55c965f67_1.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></div><figcaption>Source: Aviazapchast <a href="http://aviazapchast.com/about/partners/international-partners/">website</a></figcaption></figure><p>HAL is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India and is 71% state-owned.

The Myanmar Navy is involved in the direct commission of international crimes, as seen in the 2017 genocide against the Rohingya and more recent indiscriminate attacks from naval vessels in Arakan State. In September 2023, Myanmar <a href="https://myanmar-now.org/en/news/military-still-deploying-warships-in-southern-myanmar-battles/">independent media reported that</a> junta warships were shelling coastal villages in Palaw Township, Tanintharyi Region located on the Andaman coast. The navy also aids the army’s atrocities by transporting troops and artillery. </p><p>Increased loss of control over road networks have forced the Myanmar military to rely on maritime routes to move reinforcements, supplies, and weapons, with the role of the navy likely to be increasingly important for the junta as it wages its campaign of terror. </p><h4><strong>Goa Shipyard Limited</strong></h4><p>Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL) is a PSU under India’s Ministry of Defence. It has worked with the junta to help develop its domestic shipbuilding capabilities under a contract signed following the military’s coup attempt. GSL is 51% owned by the President of India and 47% owned by the PSU Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited. Among GSL’s <a href="https://goashipyard.in/about-us/corporate-objective/">principal objectives</a>, the company lists designing and building warships for the Indian armed forces and for export to “friendly foreign nations”.</p><p>The company’s <a href="https://goashipyard.in/file/2022/12/Annual-Report-FY-2021-22-Language-English.pdf">annual report for 2021-2022</a> lists the Myanmar Navy as an active partner, noting that its efforts to expand presence in the international market has “translated into conclusion of export contracts for… supervision for commissioning of Propulsion Plant of 81m offshore patrol vessels (OPV) for Myanmar Navy [sic].” </p><p>The Myanmar Navy has two 81m OPVs that were built in the naval shipyard in Thanlyin. UMS Inlay was commissioned in 2017 and UMS Inma was commissioned in December 2021. The vessels operate with a propulsion system using two diesel engines to power a single propeller shaft. They are armed with naval guns and contain a helipad. </p><p>The GSL contract for the propulsion plant was signed with the Myanmar Naval Dockyard on 26 October 2021. The status of the project is unclear, and the project was not referred to in GSL’s 2022-3 annual report. According to a December 2021 Indian Ministry of Defence <a href="https://loksabhadocs.nic.in/lsscommittee/Defence/17_Defence_25.pdf">report</a> to the Lok Sabha’s Standing Committee on Defence, GSL’s export turnover for 2021-3 included training for the Myanmar Navy, which may refer to training for the propulsion plant.

A recent <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1981322">communiqué of the Indian Ministry of Defence</a> confirms that on 30 November 2023, more than 1000 cadets, including 21 from “friendly foreign countries”, participated in a graduation ceremony of Indian cadets, overseen by India’s president.

As part of India’s <em>Aatma Nirbharta</em> initiative, a “Make in India Exhibition” was organised on the side-lines of the conclave to showcase India&#x27;s domestic shipbuilding industry. </p><p>In June 2023, Indian Defence Secretary Shri Giridhar Aramane <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1936668">paid an official visit</a> to Myanmar, meeting with coup leader and war criminal Min Aung Hlaing in Naypyidaw. The Defence Secretary also met with the junta’s Western sanctioned defence minister Mya Tun Oo and held meetings with the Myanmar Navy head Moe Aung and defence industry chief Lt Gen Khan Myint Than, signalling deepening cooperation and complicity with the junta. </p><p>This military cooperation continues a pattern of support India provided during and in the years after the military’s “clearance operations” against the Rohingya. Examples include:</p><ul role="list"><li>In 2020, <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1606901">a tabletop exercise</a> between the Indian and Myanmar air forces took place in Prayagraj, India. </li><li>In 2018, according to the <a href="https://www.ddpmod.gov.in/sites/default/files/Annual-Report-2018-2019.pdf">Indian Defence Ministry’s own account</a>, a mobile training team comprising seven officers and two sailors was deployed to Myanmar for three months to train 60 Myanmar soldiers on shipyard management, logistics and engineering. </li><li>India hosted bilateral India Myanmar Bilateral Army Exercises (IMBAX) in 2017 and 2019.</li><li>INS Satavahana <a href="https://www.ddpmod.gov.in/sites/default/files/Annual-Report-2018-2019.pdf">carried out ab-initio submarine training for Myanmar navy personnel</a>. </li><li>In 2017, as part of defence cooperation, <a href="https://www.ddpmod.gov.in/sites/default/files/Annual-Report-2017-2018.pdf">India hosted a four-week tailor made training capsule in Low Intensity Counter Offensive for 35 Myanmar military personnel</a> at the Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare (CIJW) School in Vairengte.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h2><strong>India acting in blatant disregard of its international human rights obligations</strong></h2><p>India has acted with full knowledge that its transfers of military equipment and provision of training and support to the Myanmar military takes place in a context in which the military is committing repeated grave violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. By providing arms, equipment and technology to the Myanmar military, India is directly supporting the junta’s brutal attacks against the people, aiding and abetting war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p><p>India’s domestic laws are currently inadequate to prevent state complicity in Myanmar atrocities. Indian exports are regulated by the <a href="https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/1947/3/A1992-22.pdf" target="_blank">Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act of 1992</a> and related rules, regulations and notifications. The legislation allows the Indian government to implement a Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) which sets the conditions for the export of restricted goods. The most recent FTP <a href="https://www.dgft.gov.in/CP/?opt=ft-policy">was issued</a> in 2023. While India has issued prohibitions on exports to Iraq, Somalia, Iran, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Venezuela, it has failed to act when it comes to Myanmar. </p><p>Arms and munitions exported by various Indian defence PSUs are covered by the <a href="https://www.mea.gov.in/Images/CPV/SCOMET-List-2023.pdf">Special Chemicals, Organisms, Materials, Equipment and Technologies (SCOMET) list</a> that specifies the items that require export permits. The present regulation does not include any mention of human rights violations in the destination country as a factor for deciding export permit authorisation.</p><p>Justice For Myanmar calls on India to immediately impose an arms embargo on the Myanmar military junta and cease all training and other military support, in recognition of the impact of its weapons exports on the Myanmar population. We also call on Indian arms companies – private and public sector – to immediately stop doing business with the Myanmar military – directly or through front companies in Myanmar – and halt any agreed consignments of additional arms and related material to the junta. </p><p>Governments and companies that are engaged with the Indian government and its arms industry should urgently do due diligence to prevent arms, equipment and technology from being diverted to the junta and use their leverage to ensure India ends its complicitly in the Myanmar junta’s atrocities.  </p><p>The fact that a large majority of the identified Indian companies supplying arms and equipment to the junta are public sector undertakings further demonstrates the Indian government’s complicitly in the Myanmar military’s atrocity crimes.</p><p>The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights – the authoritative global reference for preventing and addressing adverse human rights impacts arising from business-related activity – provide that States should take “additional” steps to protect against human rights abuses by business enterprises that are owned or controlled by the State. The Guiding Principles further note that human rights abuse by a State-owned enterprise may also constitute a violation of the State’s own international law obligations when the acts of the enterprise can be attributed to the State. As has been <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Issues/Business/InterpretationGuidingPrinciples.pdf">formally clarified</a> by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Issues/Business/finance-2021-response-nominee-shareholders.pdf">Guiding Principles apply to all types of modalities of investment</a>, including where institutions act as shareholders. These expectations are also reflected in the <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/deliver/81f92357-en.pdf?itemId=/content/publication/81f92357-en&amp;mimeType=pdf">OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on Responsible Business Conduct</a>. Taken together, these standards require investors of the Indian companies supplying the junta to engage with these companies to take appropriate harm mitigation measures. This may include suspension of exports, withdrawal of investment pending corrective action, or responsible disengagement or divestment. Government investors have an additional layer of responsibility in their vigilance under the OECD Guidelines, given that their human rights treaty obligations extend to their business conduct and to the populations that their business conduct affects. </p><p>In our view, given the illegal coup attempt and urgent human rights situation, there is no way to mitigate the business and human rights impact of weapons and related material exports to the military junta without a total stop to those exports. We call upon investors and shareholders of the identified companies to conduct updated and enhanced human rights due diligence to assess the impact of their investment and shareholding on the people of Myanmar and take mitigating action.</p><p>The Myanmar military junta has been terrorising the people of Myanmar for more than three years, with the support of India and other government providing it with funds, arms, equipment and jet fuel. International action is needed urgently to cut resources to the junta and to support the Myanmar people’s struggle for federal democracy.</p></div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876/6667459be273630d36fac109_downloads.svg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-15 w-condition-invisible"/><div class="rich-text-block-2 w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div></div></div><div class="div-block-16"><div class="featured-stories-tags">TAGS</div></div><div class="collection-list-wrapper-3 w-dyn-list"><div role="list" class="collection-list-6 w-dyn-items"><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="../tags/india.html">India</a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="../tags/bharat-electronics.html">Bharat Electronics</a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="../tags/yantra-india.html">Yantra India</a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="../tags/hindustan-aeronautics-limited.html">Hindustan Aeronautics Limited</a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="../tags/goa-shipyard-limited.html">Goa Shipyard Limited</a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="../tags/indian-air-force.html">Indian Air Force</a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="../tags/indian-oil-corporation.html">‍Indian Oil Corporation</a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="../tags/brahmos-aerospace.html">BrahMos Aerospace</a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="../tags/garden-reach-shipbuilders-and-engineers.html">Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers</a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="../tags/beml-limited.html">BEML Limited</a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="../tags/hindustan-shipyards-limited.html">Hindustan Shipyards Limited</a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="../tags/mazagon-dock-shipbuilders-limited.html">Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited</a></div></div></div></div><div class="footer container w-container"><div class="mailing-list-signup"><div class="w-form"><div class="heading-for-section"><div class="highlighter---static">This situation is evolving.</div></div><form id="email-form" name="email-form" data-name="Email Form" action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/justiceformyanmar" method="post" class="form w-clearfix" data-wf-page-id="5fdd49333a651b707dc659f7" data-wf-element-id="33e070a5-3b15-09fe-7668-a4750d487ac3"><input class="text-field w-input" maxlength="256" name="email" data-name="email" placeholder="your@email.com" type="email" id="email-3" required=""/><input class="text-field-half-width w-input" maxlength="256" name="organization" data-name="organization" placeholder="Organisation (optional)" type="text" id="organization"/><input class="text-field-half-width w-input" maxlength="256" name="name" data-name="name" placeholder="Name (optional)" type="text" id="name-3"/><input type="submit" data-wait="Please wait..." class="submit-button w-button" value="Sign Up"/><div class="div-block"><div class="w-form-formrecaptcha recaptcha g-recaptcha g-recaptcha-error g-recaptcha-disabled g-recaptcha-invalid-key"></div></div></form><div class="success-message w-form-done"><div>Thank you!

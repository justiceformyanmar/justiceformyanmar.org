Justice For Myanmar urges targeted sanctions against the entire Htoo network in order to prevent financial and arms support for the illegal Myanmar junta. </p><p>In addition, Justice For Myanmar is publishing a leaked 2018 Myanmar Air Force meeting note sheet on the conversion of planes for the Myanmar military by Yangon Aerospace Engineering Company (YAECO), a business owned by Tay Za.

Images posted by Htoo show troops unloading supplies from an AgustaWestland AW139 helicopter.   </p><p>In addition to logistical support, Htoo made financial donations to the Myanmar military in support of its “clearance operations” against the Rohingya, which was identified by the<a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/MyanmarFFM/Pages/EconomicInterestsMyanmarMilitary.aspx"> Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar</a>. In regards to Htoo and other donors, the Fact-Finding Mission concluded that “those attending and making donations at the Tatmadaw’s funding ceremonies were aware of the likelihood that their donations would substantially contribute to ensuring the Rohingya population cannot return to their villages and communities” and recommended an investigation into whether donors are criminally liable under international law.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Asia Green Development (AGD) Bank Public Company Limited</strong></p><p>AGD Bank is a public commercial bank controlled by Htoo Group.

Companies play a key role in enabling the illegal Myanmar military junta&#x27;s atrocity crimes against the people of Myanmar, and have acquired wealth through corruption and illicit business dealings.</p><p> </p><p>This feature outlines the significant companies and individuals involved in brokering arms and providing funds to the Myanmar military. </p><p>The group of companies is controlled by individuals linked to the Myanmar military, and has been involved in a wide range of business sectors, including mining, manufacturing, defence, casinos, energy, agriculture and trade.</p><p> </p><p>Notable current and former directors and shareholders in Star Sapphire Group and associated companies are: <br/>‍</p><ul role="list"><li>‍<strong>Dr Tun Min Latt</strong> – son of

He also plays a major role in facilitating arms contracts with suppliers in China, and is the Myanmar agent of arms manufacturer NORINCO, according to a source. </p><p><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/hr-bodies/hrc/myanmar-ffm/economic-interests-myanmar-military">NORINCO has provided</a> armoured personnel carriers, 100mm guns and other arms to the Myanmar army. Wanbao Mining and Myanmar Yang Tse Copper Limited, NORINCO subsidiaries, operate the notorious Letpadaung and Sabae Taung &amp; Kyay Sin Taung copper mines with MEHL. </p><p> </p><p>One leaked Ministry of Defence procurement document shows that Star Sapphire Trading Company purchased a jig and tools for ship construction on behalf of Myanmar’s navy. The budget for delivery charges alone was almost USD$300,000, re-allocated for the 2017-2018 fiscal year. We cannot confirm which company the equipment was purchased from.</p><p> </p><p>Following that, a meeting was planned to discuss ship construction between officials from the Myanmar Navy and project partners, Star Sapphire Trading Company and Israel Shipyards Ltd. Evidence of the meeting, which was scheduled to take place in a Myanmar Army Directorate of Procurement Office, comes from a leaked <a href="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876/62622971fa2a7c547f9e5ed8_Star%20Sapphire%20-%20Israel%20Shipyards.pdf">confidential letter</a> from the Commander-In-Chief of Myanmar’s navy.</p><p> </p><p>In 2015, while Myanmar was under United States and European Union arms embargoes, the Commander-in-Chief of Myanmar’s air force attended a meeting on security cooperation with the Israeli Ministry of Defence, according to a <a href="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876/626525d2dcc383c3f7f4efeb_Star%20Sapphire%20Elbit%20letter%20extract.pdf">letter</a> leaked to Justice For Myanmar. </p><p> </p><p>After the trip, the letter shows, the Star Sapphire Trading Company inquired with the Commander-in-Chief of the air force regarding the submission of orders for military equipment manufactured by Elbit Systems<strong>, </strong>the Israel-based defence electronics company. </p><p> </p><p>The equipment included a helmet display and tracking system with night vision for military pilots to be used in aircraft owned by the Myanmar Air Force; Skylark unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); and an air surveillance system. </p><p> </p><p>In the same leaked letter, the Star Sapphire Trading Company requested further guidance from the Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force in order to assist with the proper installation of defence equipment. The letter shows that the Star Sapphire Trading Company was playing a key role in facilitating the deal. </p><p>While Justice For Myanmar cannot confirm the final status of all these orders, it has been confirmed that the Myanmar military did acquire Elbit Systems&#x27; Skylark UAV, which it has used in attacks in western Myanmar. A Skylark UAV was <a href="star-sapphire-companies-funnelling-arms-and-money-to-military.html#">captured</a> by the Arakan Army in 2020, during operations in which the Myanmar military committed <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa16/0417/2019/en/">war crimes</a>. </p><p> </p><p>In early 2016, Elbit Systems – through its subsidiary Electro Optics Elop Ltd – also sold equipment to Myanmar’s navy valued at almost USD$300,000. This included systems for optimal observation, surveillance, and tracking and targeting to be installed on three frigates and two corvette warships. </p><p> </p><p>It is highly likely that this deal was also brokered by the Star Sapphire Trading Company, because a source affirms that Star Sapphire Trading Company<strong> </strong>had been the only local agent of Elbit Systems in Myanmar.</p><p> </p><p>According to another leaked letter from June 2015, the Star Sapphire Trading Company sought information about a radar system manufactured by Israel Aerospace Industries<strong> </strong>Ltd (IAI) for the Myanmar Air Force. The document claimed that the Star Sapphire Trading Company was<strong> </strong>the sole representative of IAI’s products in Myanmar, with the approval of the Israeli Ministry of Defence. </p><p> </p><p>Further, IAI – an Israeli state-owned enterprise – agreed to provide six Super-Dvora Mk III <a href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/myanmar-pariah-status-no-bar-defence-modernisation">gunboats to the Myanmar Navy,</a> delivered in April 2017. As a result, the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/MyanmarFFM/Pages/EconomicInterestsMyanmarMilitary.aspx">United Nations’ Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar</a> listed IAI as an arms and military equipment supplier to the Myanmar military.  </p><p> </p><p>The UN Fact-Finding Mission concluded in its 2019 report that Israel is one of the countries that has enabled the transfer of arms and arms-related assistance to Myanmar, despite the foreseeable adverse human rights impact.</p><p> </p><p>Notably though, an <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israel-s-top-court-just-ruled-about-arms-sales-to-myanmar-but-we-re-not-allowed-to-say-more-1.5453954">order of the Israeli Supreme Court</a> led to the revocation of military export licenses in 2017. The Israeli government also <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israel-to-bar-myanmar-officials-from-arms-expos-1.7532506">banned representatives of Myanmar from attending arms expos</a> after it was revealed that some had attended one such event in 2019, despite the export ban. </p><p>However, also in 2019, Future Science Company Limited procured Elbit Systems&#x27; UAV parts for the Myanmar military for maintenance work, according to a document leaked to <a href="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5e691d0b7de02f1fd6919876/603d4eed93d497ca35a773bc_Skylark%20UAV%20System-safe.pdf">Justice For Myanmar</a> and confirmed by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/01/world/asia/myanmar-coup-military-surveillance.html">New York Times</a>. </p><p> </p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Business links to Min Aung Hlaing&#x27;s daughter, Khin Thiri Thet Mon</strong></h4><p>More recently, one of the companies in the Star Sapphire Group, which has so far escaped being targeted for sanctions, has quietly changed its name: Star Thiri Investment Limited is now operating as Royal Mawtaung Mining Company Limited. </p><p> </p><p>The company is directly linked to the Myanmar military through some of its co-owners: Dr Win Min Soe, wife of Dr Tun Min Latt, and Dr Htet Aung, son of former brigadier-general Zin Yaw. Both currently play key roles as owners and directors of the company. </p><p> </p><p>The company has been tied to the military since it was founded in April 2020 by Dr Win Min Soe and <a href="dirty-secrets-3-min-aung-hlaings-daughter-in-secret-deal-with-mytel.html">Khin Thiri Thet Mon</a>, daughter of junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. Khin Thiri Thet Mon left the company in July 2020, according to corporate records.</p><p> </p><p>The company is registered for business in multiple sectors, including coal mining, energy, construction, finance, real estate and gambling.

The casino, Allure Resort, was built on the site of the state-owned Shan Yoma Guest House, on almost 5 acres of prime riverfront land, and opened in 2003.</p><p>For Allure Group, the deal was signed by <a href="http://blog.senate.go.th/profile/upakit.p/index.php?url=senator_history">Upakit Pachariyangkun</a>, a current Senator, Thai businessperson and former Ministry of Foreign Affairs official, who is a close and longstanding business partner of Dr Tun Min Latt. </p><p>The original agreement specified an annual lease payment to the military-controlled Directorate of Hotels and Tourism of US$120,000 or 6% of total gross revenue. </p><p>While casinos were illegal, the 1999 contract between the military junta and Allure Group specifies that the resort was to include &quot;electric and electronic machines, slot machines, and all sort of recreation and entertainment&quot;. </p><p>To operate the casino, Tun Min Latt and Upakit Pachariyangkun registered Myanmar Allure Group in 2000, according to <a href="https://opencorporates.com/companies/mm/6Fc-2000-2001">OpenCorporates</a>. </p><p>Star Sapphire Company Limited built the casino, according to an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191221053034/http://www.starsapphiregroup.com/starsapphire.php">archive</a> of the company&#x27;s website. </p><p>In November 2017, during the Myanmar military&#x27;s campaign of genocide against the Rohingya, a new deed was signed in which the Ministry of Hotels and Tourism transferred all rights, titles and interests in the casino to the Myanmar Army&#x27;s Office of the Quartermaster General. That was despite the original agreement specifying that &quot;the Directorate of Hotels and Tourism is the owner of the land.&quot;</p><p>This gave the Myanmar military the state&#x27;s 6% share of the casino&#x27;s revenue, at a time when the Ministry of Hotels and Tourism was under the National League for Democracy-led government. This also allowed the Myanmar military and Allure Group to hide the payments from parliamentary and auditor general scrutiny, under a <a href="myanmar-military-budget-and-procurement-files.html">system</a> designed to protect the military&#x27;s business interests.</p><p>Upakit Pachariyangkun again signed the 2017 contract as chairperson of Allure Group. </p><p>The Office of the Quartermaster General is sanctioned by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-uk-sanctions-target-human-rights-violations-and-abuses-in-myanmar-and-pakistan">UK</a>, <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0526">US</a> and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2021/12/backgrounder-additional-myanmar-sanctions.html">Canada</a>. </p><p>In 2013, the formerly London AIM-listed company, All Active Asset Capital, acquired a 7% stake in Myanmar Allure for US$2 million.
